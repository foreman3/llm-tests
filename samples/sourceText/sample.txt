The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about
storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those
games, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing
the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and
imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the
challenges that scene presents.
Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling
towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach.
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a
wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below.
A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an
arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of
the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron
straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls,
stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin
hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth,
hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of
Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into
the courtyard.
Phillip (playing Gareth): I want to look at the gargoyles. I
have a feeling they’re not just statues.
Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? I
want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or
is it going to collapse under our weight?
Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to
the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the
adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether
their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers
can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical
lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more
probable than others.
Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re
looking at the gargoyles?
Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures
and not decorations?
DM: Make an Intelligence check.
Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply?
DM: Sure!
Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven.
DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is
checking out the drawbridge?
In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams
up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working
together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle,
or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain.
The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous
magic items and other treasure.
One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon
Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The
DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate
its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM
might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the
players decide what they want their adventurers to do.
Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize
the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives
way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm?
Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’
actions and narrates what they experience. Because the
DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can
be exciting and unexpected.
The game has no real end; when one story or quest
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing
story called a campaign. Many people who play the
game keep their campaigns going for months or years,
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up
the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in
might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also
earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase
in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level.
There’s no winning and losing in the Dungeons &
Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are
usually understood. Together, the DM and the players
create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront
deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to
a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in
by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade,
or the player might choose to create a new character to
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a
memorable story, they all win.
Worlds of Adventure
The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game
are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and
spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of
medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and
magic that make these worlds unique.
The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist
within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to
other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane
of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this
multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of
them have been published as official settings for the D&D
game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance,

How to Play
The play of the Dungeons & Dragons game unfolds according to this basic pattern.
1. The DM describes the environment. The DM
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room,
what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on).
2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying,
“We’ll take the east door,” for example. Other times,
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer
might search a treasure chest while a second examines
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns,
but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.
Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer
wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM
might just say that the door opens and describe what lies
beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might
hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might
make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task.
In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often
relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of
an action.
3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’
actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back
to step 1.
This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more
structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the
adventure.
Often the action of an adventure takes place in the
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s
verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other
characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the
players keep track of where everyone is.
Game Dice
The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of
sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in
many bookstores.
In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10,
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the
typical cube that many games use).
Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two
different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for
Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are
woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside
these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created
by generations of D&D players for their own games. And
amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a
world of your own.
All these worlds share characteristics, but each world
is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive
monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun
setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and
the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races
unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged,
soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last
War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like
the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they’re all D&D worlds, and you can
use the rules in this book to create a character and play
in any one of them.
Your DM might set the campaign on one of these
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is
so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should
check with your DM about any house rules that will affect
your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is
the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the
setting is a published world.
Using These Rules
The D&D Basic Rules document has four main parts.
Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the rules
and guidance you need to make the character you’ll play
in the game. It includes information on the various races,
classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules
in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3.
Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond
the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success
or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game:
exploration, interaction, and combat.
Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic
in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and a
selection of typical spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.
Part 4 is especially for the Dungeon Master. It contains
instructions for how to challenge the player characters
with adversaries that are a good test of their abilities,
plus dozens of ready-to-use monster descriptions.
It also provides a sampling of magic items that the
characters can earn as their rewards for vanquishing
those monsters.
The end of the document contains supplemental material. Appendix A collects all the definitions of conditions
that can affect characters and monsters. Appendix B is a
brief discussion of deities in the game, particularly those
in the Forgotten Realms setting. Appendix C describes
the five factions in the Forgotten Realms that characters
can become associated with. Finally, a three-page character sheet provides a standardized way for players to
record and keep track of their characters’ abilities and
possessions.

D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances
surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the
opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use
the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if
you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the
5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers,
you use the 17.
More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are
presented in chapter 7.
Specific Beats General
This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that
govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits,
class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and
other game elements break the general rules in some
way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game
works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a
general rule, the specific rule wins.
Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance,
many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows,
but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That
trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance,
an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but
some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most
of the major exceptions to the rules.
Round Down
There’s one more general rule you need to know at the
outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round
down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is
one-half or greater.
Adventures
The Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of
characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon
Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability
scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment,
and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of
adventurers is one in which the characters complement
each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully
complete the adventure.
The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with
a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might
be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the
shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and
desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic
setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It
features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created
and played by the other players at the table, as well as
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might
be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background
example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100.
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20,
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71,
and 00 and 0 is 100.
When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many
dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to
add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eightsided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.
The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3”
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide
the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of
1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending
on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the
die, it’s a 2.)
The D20
Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just
bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an
outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball,
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In
cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided
die, a d20, to determine success or failure.
Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for
most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as
1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability
modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost
every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or
monster’s behalf.
Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the
rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.
1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add
the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes
includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and
how to determine an ability’s modifier.)
2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A
class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.
3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a
failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target
numbers and tells players whether their ability checks,
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.
The target number for an ability check or a saving
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC).
This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks
in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for
using the d20 in the game.

to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat
is the most structured element of a D&D session, with
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets
a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle,
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on
a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling
a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures,
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.
The Wonders of Magic
Few D&D adventures end without something magical
happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears
frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus
of chapters 10 and 11.
In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners
of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people
by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see
evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually
minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer,
a wizard walking through the streets with an animated
shield guardian as a bodyguard.
For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival.
Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without
the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without
the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and
druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.
Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who
are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader
seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a
hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor,
a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons
with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual
to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few
of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With
magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items,
the adventurers might prevail!
extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain
whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action.
Over the course of their adventures, the characters are
confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes
the adventurers and other creatures do their best to
kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the
adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical
object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers
spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle,
find something hidden, or unravel the current situation.
Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making
decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try
to do next.
Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might
take no more than a single game session to complete. A
long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions
to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real
time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the
adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy
the spoils of their labors.
But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of
an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made
up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole
series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from
start to finish.
The Three Pillars of Adventure
Adventurers can try to do anything their players can
imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities
in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction,
and combat.
Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement
through the world and their interaction with objects and
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the
give-and-take of the players describing what they want
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale,
that might involve the characters spending a day crossing
a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean
one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see
what happens.
Social interaction features the adventurers talking to
someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner,
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading
a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the
adventurers.
The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and
social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3
and personality traits in chapter 4.
Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells,
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort

Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.
Your race also increases one or more of your ability
scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.
Record the traits granted by your race on your
character sheet. Be sure to note your starting
languages and your base speed as well.
Building Bruenor, Step 1
Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides
that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants
to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his
character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the
languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.
2. Choose a Class
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly
describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he
or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely
to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters,
or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes
are described in chapter 3.
Your character receives a number of benefits from
your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class
features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set
your character apart from members of other classes. You
also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons,
skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do
particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a
convincing lie.
On your character sheet, record all the features that
your class gives you at 1st level.
Level
Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in
level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP).
A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring
world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a
pirate and done dangerous things before.
Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s entry into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar
with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&D
campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a
higher level, on the assumption that your character has
already survived a few harrowing adventures.
Record your level on your character sheet. If you’re
starting at a higher level, record the additional elements
your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also record your experience points. A 1st-level character has
0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the
minimum amount of XP required to reach that level
(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter).
Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your character’s hit points define how tough your character is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your
hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit
Point Dice).
Your first step in playing an adventurer in the
Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a
character of your own. Your character is a combination
of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and
a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the
personality, appearance, and backstory of your character.
Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons &
Dragons world.
Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the
kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a
flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in
an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue
who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who
picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction
featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of
one of those races. Do you want your character to be the
toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter
class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look
at the illustrations in this book to see what catches
your interest.
Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps
in order, making decisions that reflect the character you
want. Your conception of your character might evolve
with each choice you make. What’s important is that you
come to the table with a character you’re excited to play.
Throughout this chapter, we use the term character
sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character,
whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the
end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece
of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a
fine place to start until you know what information you
need and how you use it during the game.
Building Bruenor
Each step of character creation includes an example of
that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf
character, Bruenor.
1. Choose a Race
Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most
common player character races are dwarves, elves,
halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces,
such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides
more information about these races.
The race you choose contributes to your character’s
identity in an important way, by establishing a general
appearance and the natural talents gained from culture
and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain
weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the
ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For
example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them
exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful
wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too.

3. Determine Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends
on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability
has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.
The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary
table provides a quick reference for what qualities are
measured by each ability, what races increases which
abilities, and what classes consider each ability particularly important.
You generate your character’s six ability scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the
highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five
more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to
save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining
ability scores, you can use the following scores instead:
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Now take your six numbers and write each number
beside one of your character’s six abilities to assign
scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to
your ability scores as a result of your race choice.
After assigning your ability scores, determine your
ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers
table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide
the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to
each of your scores.
Building Bruenor, Step 3
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13,
12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he
puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash
fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older,
wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in
Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his
Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers
look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (–1), Wisdom 13 (+1),
Charisma 12 (+1).
Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.
At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die
type is determined by your class. You start with hit points
equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your
class description. (You also add your Constitution modifier, which you’ll determine in step 3.) This is also your
hit point maximum.
Record your character’s hit points on your character
sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses
and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you
can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in
chapter 8).
Proficiency Bonus
The table that appears in your class description shows
your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level
character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the
numbers you’ll be recording on your character sheet:
• Attack rolls using weapons you’re proficient with
• Attack rolls with spells you cast
• Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in
• Ability checks using tools you’re proficient with
• Saving throws you’re proficient in
• Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each
spellcasting class)
Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your
saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and
tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools
in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill
and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more
proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as
well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die
roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your
proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved,
for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once
to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than
once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only
once, and halve it only once.
Building Bruenor, Step 2
Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe,
one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a
fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level
class features on his character sheet.
As a 1st-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10—
and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number
after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (see
step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1stlevel character, which is +2.

4. Describe Your Character
Once you know the basic game aspects of your character,
it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about
what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in
general terms.
Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out
your character’s physical appearance and personality
traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral
compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals.
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that
could one day undermine him or her.
Your character’s background describes where he or
she came from, his or her original occupation, and the
character’s place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in
chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft
a background that’s a more precise fit for your character concept.
A background gives your character a background
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills,
and it might also give you additional languages or
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this
information, along with the personality information
you develop, on your character sheet.
Your Character’s Abilities
Take your character’s ability scores and race into account
as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A
very strong character with low Intelligence might think
and behave very differently from a very smart character
with low Strength.
For example, high Strength usually corresponds
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with
low Strength might be scrawny or plump.
A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and
slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either
gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered.
A character with high Constitution usually looks
healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail.
A character with high Intelligence might be highly
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details.
A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on.
A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded,
foolhardy, or oblivious.
A character with high Charisma exudes confidence,
which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating
presence. A character with a low Charisma might come
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.
Variant: Customizing Ability Scores
At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method
described here allows you to build a character with a set
of ability scores you choose individually.
You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The
cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point
Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points.
Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can
end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t
have a score lower than 8.
This method of determining ability scores enables you
to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones
(15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of
numbers between those extremes.

11 Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Your character needs to be proficient with armor and
shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor
and shield proficiencies are determined by your class.
There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in
chapter 5.
Some spells and class features give you a different way
to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that
give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose
which one to use.
Weapons
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the
modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and
the damage you deal when you hit.
When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate
ability modifier.
• For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your
Dexterity modifier instead.
• For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon
that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can
use your Strength modifier instead.
Building Bruenor, Step 5
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter
class and the folk hero background. His starting equipment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to
give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18.
For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe
and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so
Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and
damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3)
plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his
Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total
of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe,
Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown
weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the
weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits.
6. Come Together
Most D&D characters don’t work alone. Each character plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers
working together for a common purpose. Teamwork
and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances
to survive the many perils in the worlds of Dungeons &
Dragons. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they
met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.
Building Bruenor, Step 4
Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his
sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a
healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a
degree of forgetfulness.
Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but
his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor
was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic
destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the
folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.
Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality
in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is
a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff,
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from
the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes
that no one is above the law.
Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires
to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the
shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is
tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for
orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy
even when it might not be warranted.
5. Choose Equipment
Your class and background determine your character’s
starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and
other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your
character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5,
“Equipment.“
Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class
and background, you can purchase your starting equipment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend
based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive
lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chapter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost
(see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5).
Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity.
Armor Class
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your
character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that
contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all
characters wear armor or carry shields, however.
Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals
10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character
wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your
AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on
your character sheet.

 Chapter 1: Step-by-Step Characters
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Beyond 1st Level
As your character goes on adventures and overcomes
challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by
experience points. A character who reaches a specified
experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called gaining a level.
When your character gains a level, his or her class
often grants additional features, as detailed in the class
description. Some of these features allow you to increase
your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each
or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability
score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency
bonus increases at certain levels.
Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit
Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier
to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit
point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value
shown in your class entry, which is the average result of
the die roll (rounded up).
When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your
hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have
attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as
a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to
18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to
+4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.
The Character Advancement table summarizes the
XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through
level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that
level. Consult the information in your character’s class
description to see what other improvements you gain at
each level.
Tiers of Play
The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the
four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated
with them; they are a general description of how the play
experience changes as characters gain levels.
In the first tier (levels 1–4), characters are effectively
apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features
that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features
as they advance (such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition or a
fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads
or villages.
In the second tier (levels 5–10), characters come into
their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level
spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold
of magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain
the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These
characters have become important, facing dangers that
threaten cities and kingdoms.
In the third tier (levels 11–16), characters have reached
a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary
populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to
6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously
impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks
or do more impressive things with those attacks. These
mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.
At the fourth tier (levels 17–20), characters achieve
the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the
world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.

 Chapter 2: Races
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Chapter 2: Races
A visit to one of the great cities in the worlds of
Dungeons & Dragons—Waterdeep, the Free City of
Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors—
overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless
different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens
of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded
streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their
inhabitants.
And the people themselves—people of varying size,
shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles
and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful
elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.
Scattered among the members of these more common
races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here,
pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling
there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A
group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever
wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and
half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully
belonging to the races of either of their parents. And
there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive
from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The
Player’s Handbook has more information about these
unusual races.
Choosing a Race
Humans are the most common people in the worlds of
D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves,
halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your
character belongs to one of these peoples.
Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves,
halflings, and humans are the most common races to
produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical
parties. Other races and subraces are less common as
adventurers.
Your choice of race affects many different aspects of
your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that
exist throughout your character’s adventuring career.
When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of
character you want to play. For example, a halfling could
be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a
tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.
Your character race not only affects your ability scores
and traits but also provides the cues for building your
character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter
includes information to help you roleplay a character of
that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These
details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for
their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character
is different, as a helpful way to think about your character’s background and personality.
Racial Traits
The description of each race includes racial traits that are
common to members of that race. The following entries
appear among the traits of most races.
Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.
Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race
is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected
lifespan. This information can help you decide how old
your character is at the start of the game. You can choose
any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example,
if you play a young or very old character, your age could
explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score,
while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence
or Wisdom.
Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments,
described in this entry. These are not binding for player
characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for
example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you
better define your character.
Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category
including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall),
which means that certain rules of the game affect them
differently. The most important of these rules is that
Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons,
as explained in chapter 5.
Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).
Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read,
and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most
common languages of the D&D multiverse.
Subraces
Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have
the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary
significantly from race to race and world to world. In the
Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain
dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans
of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live
far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield
dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.

Dwarf
“Yer late, elf!” came the rough edge of a familiar
voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his
dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay
on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort,
the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and graystreaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome
sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out
an’ looked for ye!”
—R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the
roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers
in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan
and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—
these common threads unite all dwarves.
Short and Stout
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors,
miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they
stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and
compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing
nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are
also easily a match for any of the larger folk.
Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and
groom them carefully.
Long Memory, Long Grudges
Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the
oldest living dwarves often remember a very different
world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living
in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)
can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when
orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile
that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as
humans and halflings lack.
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains
they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic
endurance and little change. They respect the traditions
of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the
world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of
those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves,
who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill
in battle, and devotion to the forge.
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to
their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point
of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of
justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the
dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt
for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
Clans and Kingdoms
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and
forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry
of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves
this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t
find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They
dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings
frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water
routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome
in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits
even to them.
The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and
invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be
clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some
become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after
for their courage and loyalty.
Gods, Gold, and Clan
Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be
motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for
a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command
or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire
to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry
are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to
restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the
clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after
Slow to Trust
Dwarves get along passably well with most other races.
“The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is
about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be
hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be
for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a
dwarf’s trust.
Elves. “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling
what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s
head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword.
They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them,
though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they
have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come
streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have
at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt
they hate the orcs as much as we do.”
Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me
a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a
treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How
can you take them seriously?”
Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human,
and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky,
she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s
got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can
make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their
hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s
hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that
kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more
often than not.”

 Chapter 2: Races
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common
and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and
guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
Subrace. Two main subraces of dwarves populate the
worlds of D&D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves.
Choose one of these subraces.
Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and
remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerûn in
their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are
the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the
Dragonlance setting.
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you
gain a level.
Mountain Dwarf
As a mountain dwarf, you’re strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably
on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerûn, as well
as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of
Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.
Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2.
Dwarven Armor Training. You have proficiency with
light and medium armor.
Elf
“I have never imagined such beauty existed,”
Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but
the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.
The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled
city of Qualinost.
Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining
silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared
through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths,
they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet
they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might
overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s
only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The
elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.
—Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman,
Dragons of Autumn Twilight
having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe
wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle
centuries ago.
Dwarf Names
A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance
with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been
used and reused down through the generations. A
dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.
A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name
is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any
dwarven name in its place.
Male Names: Adrik, Alberich, Baern, Barendd, Brottor,

Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2.
Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but
they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50.
On average, they live about 350 years.
Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a
belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a
just order.
Size. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed
is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see
in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern
color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving
throws against poison, and you have resistance against
poison damage (explained in chapter 9).
Dwarven Combat Training. You have proficiency with
the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies,
or mason’s tools.
Stonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence
(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are
considered proficient in the History skill and add double
your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
Duergar
In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray
dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the
surface world for captives, then sell their prey to the other
races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities
to become invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size.

Exploration and Adventure
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they
are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration
and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society,
which is regimented from day to day but constantly
changing over decades, so they find careers that let them
travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy
exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some
might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and
others might become champions of moral causes.
Elf Names
Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday,
and before this period they are called by child names.
On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name,
although those who knew him or her as a youngster
might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult
name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the
names of respected individuals or other family members.
Little distinction exists between male names and
female names; the groupings here reflect only general
tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name,
typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves
traveling among humans translate their family names
into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.
Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil,
Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai,
Syllin, Thia, Vall
Male Adult Names: Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis,
Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan,
Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios,
Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon,
Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis
Female Adult Names: Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna,
Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia,
Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna,
Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe,
Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia,
Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places
of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in
silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music
drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the
breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.
Slender and Graceful
With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear
hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many
other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on
average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over
6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing
only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about
the same height, and males are only marginally heavier
than females.
Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human
range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze,
and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes
like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and
little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.
A Timeless Perspective
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived
races more deeply. They are more often amused than
excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They
tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.
When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring
on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be
focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends
and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply
to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with
vengeance.
Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to
violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can
simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises,
elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with
sword, bow, and strategy.
Hidden Woodland Realms
Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support
themselves without the need for clearing and plowing
land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked
clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is
usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by
trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach
swordplay or magic to their children.
Haughty but Gracious
Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious
even to those who fall short of their high expectations—
which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just
about anyone.
Dwarves. “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they
lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up
in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art
that approaches elven quality.”
Halflings. “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and
that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care
for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven
themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”
Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to
accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—
human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then
you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to
appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down
and learn some refinement.”

Subrace. Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves,
and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. This
document presents two of these subraces to choose
from. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still
further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the
Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.
High Elf
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of
D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which
includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk,
the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the
Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing
themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other
elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves
of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more
friendly, and often encountered among humans and
other races.
The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black,
or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black.
Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are
much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with
blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,
but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not
uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked
with gold.
Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
Cantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the
wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.
Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one
extra language of your choice.
Wood Elf
As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and
your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through
your native forests. This category includes the wild elves
(grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk
and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also
called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.
Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward
browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.
Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.
Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed increases
to 35 feet.
Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when
you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.
Family Names (Common Translations): Amakiir
(Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel
(Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir
(Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne
(Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel
(Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)
Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the
result of thousands of years of elven refinement.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about
the same age as humans, the elven understanding of
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass
worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
to be 750 years old.
Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects
of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well
as their own, and they are more often good than not.
Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.
Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.
(The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”)
While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
dreams are actually mental exercises that have become
reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this
way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8
hours of sleep.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and
their songs and poems are famous among other races.
Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish
ballads to their repertoires.
The Darkness of the Drow
Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow
would be universally reviled. Their depraved society is
preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess,
who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire
families as noble houses vie for position. Drow grow
up believing that surface-dwelling races are worthless
except as slaves.
Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the
Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North,
has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the
weak and innocent.

Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any
living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing
what they have even in lean times.
Blend into the Crowd
Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable
and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth
and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.
Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal
to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can
display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families,
or communities are threatened.
Pastoral Pleasantries
Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with
large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build
kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond
their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort
of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family
elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional
ways despite the rise and fall of empires.
Many halflings live among other races, where the
halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling
communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or
guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no
permanent home.
Exploring Opportunities
Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore
a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring
is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a
necessity.
Halfling Names
A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly
a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that
stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through
the generations.
Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich,
Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn,
Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby
Female Names: Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia,
Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela,
Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna
Family Names: Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle,
High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage,
Tosscobble, Underbough
Halfling Traits
Your halfling character has a number of traits in common
with all other halflings.
Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20
and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.
Halfling
Regis the halfling, the only one of his kind for
hundreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers behind
his head and leaned back against the mossy blanket of the
tree trunk. Regis was short, even by the standards of his
diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely
cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as
his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of
his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly
in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.
—R.A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard
The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’
lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation.
Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that
travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide
horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth,
and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along
an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.
Small and Practical
The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing
between 40 and 45 pounds.
Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and
wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often
sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them
and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple,
comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.
Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing.
They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures
and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest
of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather
than on display for all to see. They have
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.
Kind and Curious
Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well
as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few
dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among
them usually venture into the world for reasons of
community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They
love discovering new things, even simple things, such
as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.

Human
These were the stories of a restless people who
long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to
pillage and terrorize, then to settle. Yet there was an energy,
a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the
night Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle.
She’d never given much thought to humans, but these stories fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of bold
heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and
a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land.
—Elaine Cunningham, Daughter of the Drow
In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene
and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and
dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that
they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years
they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something
to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their
mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.
Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the
achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.
A Broad Spectrum
With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans
are more physically diverse than other common races.
There is no typical human. An individual can stand from
5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250
pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black
to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly,
kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is
sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages.
Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely
live even a single century.
Alignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule,
they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in
pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are
also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on
the support of their community and the comfort of
their old ways.
Size. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh
about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet.
Lucky. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and
must use the new roll.
Brave. You have advantage on saving throws against
being frightened.
Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space
of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common
and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but
halflings are loath to share it with others. They write
very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature.
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all
halflings speak Common to converse with the people
in whose lands they dwell or through which they are
traveling.
Subrace. The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and
stout, are more like closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these subraces.
Lightfoot
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice,
even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be
affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten
Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and
thus are the most common variety.
Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a
nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings
are called hairfeet or tallfellows.
Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.
Naturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide even when
you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one
size larger than you.
Stout
As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have
some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have
dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings
are called stronghearts, and they’re most common in
the south.
Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1.
Stout Resilience. You have advantage on saving
throws against poison, and you have resistance against
poison damage.
Affable and Positive
Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to
make sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones.
Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count
on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile
once in a while?”
Elves. “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music,
their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful
dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their
smiling faces—surely more than they ever let on.”
Humans. “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some
of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to
the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not
that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—
you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their
own lands, they protect us as well.”

found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups,
and the typical names of their members, can be used as
inspiration no matter which world your human is in.
Calishite
Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans,
Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re
found primarily in southwest Faerûn.
Calishite Names: (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid,
Khemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female)
Atala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira,
Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid,
Mostana, Pashar, Rein
Chondathan
Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown
hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black.
Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these
traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan
descent dominate the central lands of Faerûn, around
the Inner Sea.
Chondathan Names: (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur,
Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd;
(female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri,
Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown,
Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag
Damaran
Found primarily in the northwest of Faerûn, Damarans
are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging
from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black,
and their eye color varies widely, though brown is
most common.
Damaran Names: (Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan,
Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra,
Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora;
(surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk,
Nemetsk, Shemov, Starag
Variety in All Things
Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people
among the common races. They have widely varying
tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands
where they have settled. When they settle, though, they
stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual
human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins
far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They
live fully in the present—making them well suited to the
adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to
leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to
changing political and social dynamics.
Lasting Institutions
Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret,
humans found sacred orders and institutions for such
purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on
the ancient traditions to each new generation, human
temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix
their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream
of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they
achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when
they are gone.
Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general
their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large
numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of
humans who live in nonhuman lands.
Exemplars of Ambition
Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and
ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They
seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing
power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.
Human Names and Ethnicities
Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human
parents give their children names from other languages,
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less
correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to
their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their
ancestors.
The material culture and physical characteristics of
humans can change wildly from region to region. In
the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in
the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in
distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more
distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations
of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver
Marches have every possible variation of coloration
and features.
In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups
are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are
Everyone’s Second-Best Friends
Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle
with members of other races. They get along with almost
everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans
serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants,
and functionaries of all kinds.
Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to
their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
Elves. “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They
don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as
peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that
damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you
can learn a lot from them.”
Halflings. “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home,
as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good
food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If
halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount
to something.”

position in that range, your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common

Chapter 3: Classes
Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by
a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never
dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark
places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser
women and men can’t stand against.
Class is the primary definition of what your character
can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world
and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example,
might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and
maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much
larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as
a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict
brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might
know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who
share his faith.
Your class gives you a variety of special features,
such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and
a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you
only two or three features, but as you advance in level
you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table
summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and
a detailed explanation of each one.
Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one
class. A rogue might switch direction in life and dabble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a
rogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with
magical training and advance as fighters and wizards
simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in
this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the Player’s Handbook.
Four basic classes—listed in the Classes table—are
found in almost every D&D world and define most typical
adventurers. See the Player’s Handbook for information
about other classes.

Cleric
Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.
Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in
wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed
against him, shouting praise to the gods with every
foe’s fall.
Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive
back the zombies crowding in on her companions.
Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with
divine magic.
Healers and Warriors
Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the
gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects.
The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it,
but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.
Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient
rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion
and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague
or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit
most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their
combat training to let them wade into melee with the
power of the gods on their side.
Divine Agents
Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and

have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to
prove yourself worthy of a great quest?
Quick Build
You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score,
followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the
acolyte background.
Class Features
As a cleric, you gain the following class features.
Hit Points
Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st
Proficiencies
Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields
Weapons: Simple weapons

• (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail
(if proficient)
sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a
stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare
in most hierarchies.
When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations,
or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to
enter the world.
Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to
established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a
position to demand it.
Creating a Cleric
As you create a cleric, the most important question to
consider is which deity to serve and what principles you
want your character to embody. The Player’s Handbook
includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse.
Check with your DM to learn which deities are in
your campaign.
Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly?
Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service
with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple
priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity

Divine Domain
Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life
domain is detailed at the end of the class description and
provides examples of gods associated with it. See the
Player’s Handbook for details on all the domains.
Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you
additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th,
8th, and 17th levels.
Domain Spells
Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that
you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it
prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day.
If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
Channel Divinity
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and
an effect determined by your domain. Some domains
grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as
noted in the domain description.
When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which
effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest
to use your Channel Divinity again.
Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your cleric spell save DC.
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you
can use it three times between rests. When you finish a
short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move
to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the
Dodge action.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.
• (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any
simple weapon
• (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• A shield and a holy symbol
Spellcasting
As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.
Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.
Preparing and Casting Spells
The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for
you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you
do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of
16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of
1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1stlevel or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it
from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Wisdom modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
25
 Chapter 3: Classes
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Destroy Undead
Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.
Destroy Undead
Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR . . .
5th 1/2 or lower
8th 1 or lower
11th 2 or lower
14th 3 or lower
17th 4 or lower
Divine Intervention
Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile
dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the
nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or
cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again
for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.
Divine Domains
In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different
aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s
domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence
are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of
Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one
aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are
granted powers related to that domain.
Your choice might correspond to a particular sect
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo,
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in
a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively,
your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals
to you most.
Each domain’s description gives examples of deities
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included
from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of
antiquity.
Life Domain
The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that
sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and
health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for
those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence
over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such
as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as
Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing
or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and
Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as
Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).
Life Domain Spells
Cleric Level Spells
1st bless, cure wounds
3rd lesser restoration, spiritual weapon
5th beacon of hope, revivify
7th death ward, guardian of faith
9th mass cure wounds, raise dead
Bonus Proficiency
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
Disciple of Life
Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher
to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to heal the badly injured.
As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of hit points
equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures
within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature
on an undead or a construct.
Blessed Healer
Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level
or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than
you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.
Supreme Healing
Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one
or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead
use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you
restore 12.

Creating a Fighter
As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get
your combat training, and what set you apart from the
mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly
ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps
because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you
to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself
might all have been factors.
You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history.
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested.
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor?
They might have been military issue or family heirlooms,
or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them.
Your armaments are now among your most important
possessions—the only things that stand between you and
death’s embrace.
Quick Build
You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest
ability score, depending on whether you want to focus
on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons).
Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second,
choose the soldier background.
Fighter
A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before
her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind
her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins
with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc
nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.
A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the
ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow
aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings
two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre,
looking for a blind spot in its defenses.
A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving
them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical
advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light
an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to
smite him.
All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons &
Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries,
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough
knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well
acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it
defiantly in the face.
Well-Rounded Specialists
Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes
in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter
is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond
that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes
in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and
some on augmenting their martial skills with magic.
This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants
on battlefields and in dungeons alike.
Trained for Danger
Not every member of the city watch, the village militia,
or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are
relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic
combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers,
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.
Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other
dangerous work common among adventurers is second
nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he
or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but
also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch
have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue
sword, for example.

Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add
your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on
to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use

fighter level.
Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use it again.

level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on
the same turn.
Martial Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive
to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. The

20th level in this class.
Indomitable
Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that
you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, and you

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than
you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction
to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be
wielding a shield.

Rogue
Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the
shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the
door open.
A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When
their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway,
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate,
and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.
Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and
magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and
she and her companions are free to make their escape.
Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a
knack for finding the solution to just about any problem,
demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is
the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.
Skill and Precision
Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of
a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and
deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
disarming traps, and opening locks.
When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will
hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a
barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural
knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks
to supplement their other abilities.
A Shady Living
Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them
live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a
living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’
guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to
help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make
an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where
dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.
As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law.
Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their
fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of
adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned
and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of
infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search
of treasure.
Creating a Rogue
As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal
Martial Archetypes
Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you
choose to emulate reflects your approach.
Champion
The archetypal Champion focuses on the development
of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection.
Those who model themselves on this archetype combine
rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.
Improved Critical
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd
level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll
of 19 or 20.
Remarkable Athlete
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency
bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn’t already use your
proficiency bonus.
In addition, when you make a running long jump, the
distance you can cover increases by a number of feet
equal to your Strength modifier.
Additional Fighting Style
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the
Fighting Style class feature.
Superior Critical
Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.
Survivor
At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points
equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no
more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this
benefit if you have 0 hit points.

D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.
Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and
exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an
extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack
if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must
use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t
incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the
attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain
levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column
of the Rogue table.
Thieves’ Cant
During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to
hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands
such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and
symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as
whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’
guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in
an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
thieves on the run.
past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or
from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave
your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards?
Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some
other desire or ideal?
What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong
cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were
lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you
needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you
suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your
mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or
maybe you made a new friend—another member of your
adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for
earning a living and employing your particular talents.
Quick Build
You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability
score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to
excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you
plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Second, choose the criminal background.

 Chapter 3: Classes
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding
when you need to. If your attack misses a target within
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.
Roguish Archetypes
Rogues have many features in common, including their
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your
choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not
necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a
description of your preferred techniques.
Thief
You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars,
bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers,
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using
magic items you normally couldn’t employ.
Fast Hands
Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm
a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.
Second-Story Work
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the
ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer
costs you extra movement.
In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to
your Dexterity modifier.
Supreme Sneak
Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed
on the same turn.
Use Magic Device
By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items
even when they are not intended for you. You ignore
all class, race, and level requirements on the use of
magic items.
Thief’s Reflexes
When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take
two turns during the first round of any combat. You take
your first turn at your normal initiative and your second
turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature
when you are surprised.
Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus
action on each of your turns in combat. This action can
be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
Roguish Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in
the exercise of your rogue abilities. The Thief archetype
is detailed here; see the Player’s Handbook for other archetypes. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and
then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th,
16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.
Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see
hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve
the attack’s damage against you.
Evasion
Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the
way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half
damage if you fail.
Reliable Talent
By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Blindsense
Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature
within 10 feet of you.
Slippery Mind
By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength.
You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
Elusive
Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers
rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has
advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.

Wizard
Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf
closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front
of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead
of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.
Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones
a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
plane beyond.
Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly,
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the
passage to his left.
Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception,
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future,
or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells
change one substance into another, call meteors down
from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.
Scholars of the Arcane
Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the
power of magic draws students who seek to master its
mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell
requires merely the utterance of a few strange words,
fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of
exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at
the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and
countless hours of study.
Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is
secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and
grow in experience. They can also learn them from other
wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.
The Lure of Knowledge
Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard
is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage
or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the
secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives
of crime or domination.
But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the
most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and
lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could
unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age. The Wizard

Creating a Wizard
Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your
character first come into contact with magic? How did
you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a
natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice
incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an
ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?
What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your
first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for
more? Have you received word of a secret repository of
knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical
skills to the test in the face of danger.
Quick Build
You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability
score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second,
choose the sage background. Third, choose the light,
mage hand, and ray of frost cantrips, along with the
following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning
hands, charm person, mage armor, magic missile, shield,
and sleep.
Class Features
As a wizard, you gain the following class features.
Hit Points
Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level
Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your
Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st
Proficiencies
Armor: None
Weapons: Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs,
light crossbows
Tools: None
Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom
Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight,
Investigation, Medicine, and Religion
Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the
equipment granted by your background:
• (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger
• (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
• (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack
• A spellbook
Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true
power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.
Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Wizard table.
Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level
wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips,
which are fixed in your mind.
Preparing and Casting Spells
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have
to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast
one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available
for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells
from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier +
your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must
be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include
six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen
from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell
magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your
list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells
requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
spell on your list.
Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated
study and memorization. You use your Intelligence
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus +
your Intelligence modifier
Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You
don’t need to have the spell prepared.
Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.
33
 Chapter 3: Classes
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each
of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures,
you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).
Arcane Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to
recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is
equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover
up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a
2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.
Arcane Tradition
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight
schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation.
The school of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class
description; see the Player’s Handbook for information
on the other schools.
Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.
Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a
1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have
them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher
level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one
or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the
same levels.
Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as
your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you
have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd
level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you
must expend a spell slot as normal.
Arcane Traditions
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the
earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with various traditions
dedicated to its complex study.
The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse
revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through
the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools, as described
in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic
departments, with rival faculties competing for students
and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the
solitude of their own towers use the division of magic
into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each
school require mastery of different techniques.
Your Spellbook
The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll
in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in
an ancient library.
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard
spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook
if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare
the time to decipher and copy it.
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook
using your own notation.
For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your
other spells.
Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own
spellbook into another book—for example, if you want
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and
easier, since you understand your own notation and already
know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and
10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared
into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your
spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as
normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup
spellbooks in a safe place.
The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume
that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a
loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost
your previous spellbook in a mishap.

School of Evocation
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling
thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some
evokers find employment in military forces, serving as
artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some
seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.
Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell
into your spellbook is halved.
Sculpt Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative
safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When
you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures
that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal
to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell,
and they take no damage if they would normally take half
damage on a successful save.
Potent Cantrip
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even
creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip,
the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but
suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.
Empowered Evocation
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence
modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation
spell you cast.
Overchannel
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of
your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st
through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If
you use this feature again before you finish a long rest,
you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell,
immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this
feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic
damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage
ignores resistance and immunity.

You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex
and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen
as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play
a female character who presents herself as a man, a man
who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female
dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise,
your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide.
Height and Weight
You can decide your character’s height and weight, using
the information provided in your race description or on
the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what
your character’s ability scores might say about his or
her height and weight. A weak but agile character might
be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or
just heavy.
If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character’s height and weight using the Random Height and
Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier
column determines the character’s extra height (in
inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight
Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight
(in pounds) beyond the base weight.
Random Height and Weight

Dwarf, mountain 4' +2d4 130 lb. × (2d6) lb.
Elf, high 4'6" +2d10 90 lb. × (1d4) lb.
Elf, wood 4'6" +2d10 100 lb. × (1d4) lb.
Halfling 2'7" +2d4 35 lb. × 1 lb.
For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8
inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets
a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the
player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4
pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36
pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total
of 146 pounds.
Other Physical Characteristics
You choose your character’s age and the color of his or
her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness,
you might want to give your character an unusual or
memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp,
or a tattoo.
Alignment
A typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral
and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral),
and the other describes attitudes toward society and
Characters are defined by much more than their
race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories,
interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those
that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the
details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the
rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points
of personality and alignment.
Character Details
Your character’s name and physical description might be
the first things that the other players at the table learn
about you. It’s worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.
Name
Your character’s race description includes sample names
for members of that race. Put some thought into your
name even if you’re just picking one from a list.
Sex
You can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your
character does or does not conform to the broader culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior.
For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional
gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to
the surface.
Chapter 4: Personality and Background
Tika and Artemis: Contrasting Characters
The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting
your character apart from every other character. Consider
the following two human fighters.
Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a
brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s
trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the
proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and
took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But
when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace
and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure
alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite
weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her
skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the
Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility
to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds
of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the
notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the
city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite
his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one
of the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale
to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer,
constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.
Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with
some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high
Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.

Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical
choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks
are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil;
they have no alignment.
Languages
Your race indicates the languages your character can
speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice.
Note these languages on your character sheet.
Choose your languages from the Standard Languages
table, or choose one that is common in your campaign.
With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a
language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.
Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial
language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran
dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language
can communicate with one another.

order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct
alignments define the possible combinations.
These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment.
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical
behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently
faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.
Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud
giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.
Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.
Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with
law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some
wizards are lawful neutral.
Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to
steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing
what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and
many humans are neutral.
Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims,
holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.
Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they
want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.
Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do
whatever they can get away with, without compassion or
qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths
are neutral evil.
Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence,
spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red
dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.
Alignment in the Multiverse
For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral
choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid
races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned
gods who created these races gave them free will to
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free
will is slavery.
The evil deities who created other races, though, made
those races to serve them. Those races have strong
inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods.
Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god,
Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an
orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the
lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)
Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil,
and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful
evil, it would cease to be a devil.
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned.
Tika and Artemis: Alignment
Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted
and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least
professional in his approach to murder.
As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer.
He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with
heroes when he must—and when it’s in his own best
interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems
in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests
and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains
and monsters.

threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving
a character’s motivations and goals.
Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do
you care most about? To what place do you feel a special
connection? What is your most treasured possession?
Your bonds might be tied to your class, your
background, your race, or some other aspect of your character’s history or personality. You might also gain new
bonds over the course of your adventures.
Flaws
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s
flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could
exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against
your best interests. More significant than negative
personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept,
or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?
Inspiration
Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true
to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By
using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait
of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in
negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let
you call on your bond to the defense of your home village
to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.
Gaining Inspiration
Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety
of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out
your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your
character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how
you can earn inspiration in the game.
You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t
stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.
Using Inspiration
If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make
an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending
your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.
Personal Characteristics
Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of
traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a
person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her
to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals,
bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about
your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you
can imagine.
Each background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics that you can use to
spark your imagination. You’re not bound to those options, but they’re a good starting point.
Personality Traits
Give your character two personality traits. Personality
traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality
traits should tell you something interesting and fun about
your character. They should be self-descriptions that are
specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m
smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of
characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you
something specific about your character’s interests and
disposition.
Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your
character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude
or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.
A useful place to start thinking about personality traits
is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive
or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score,
for example, or be cocky about your high score.
Ideals
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals
are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to
act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life
goals to your core belief system.
Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are
the principles that you will never betray? What would
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act
and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single
most important thing you strive for?
You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s
alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each
background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law,
chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more
to do with the particular background than with moral or
ethical perspectives.
Bonds
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a
character’s connections to people, places, and events in
the world. They tie you to things from your background.
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead
you to act against your own best interests if they are
Tika and Artemis: Character Details
Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri
set these characters apart from each other and reflect their
personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove
that she’s not just a kid any more, and her name makes her
sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an
exotic land and carries a more mysterious name.
Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring
career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with
freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small
man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features
and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a
shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes
are gray and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his
life and soul.

more money? How did you learn the skills of your class?
What sets you apart from ordinary people who share
your background?
The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both
concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages)
and roleplaying suggestions.
Proficiencies
Each background gives a character proficiency in two
skills. Skills are described in chapter 7.
In addition, most backgrounds give a character
proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5.
If a character would gain the same proficiency from
two different sources, he or she can choose a different
proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.
Languages
Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn
additional languages beyond those given by race.
See “Languages” earlier in this chapter.
Equipment
Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend
coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment
from your background.
Suggested Characteristics
A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background. You can pick
characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or
use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of
your own creation.
Customizing a Background
You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign
setting. To customize a background, you can replace
one feature with any other one, choose any two skills,
and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the
equipment package from your background or spend coin
on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you
can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your
class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal,
one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that
matches your desired background, work with your DM to
create one.
Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward
another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or
simply doing something exciting in the game. When
another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can
give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.
Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where you came from, how you became
an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter
might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan.
Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.
Choosing a background provides you with important
story cues about your character’s identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what
changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you
get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you
come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have
Tika and Artemis: Personal Characteristics
Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika
Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights
resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis
Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a
quick, precise confidence.
Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost
childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance
of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she
cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never
allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly
challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful
evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a
lust for power.
Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home.
The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and
her friendship with her adventuring companions was
forged during her time working there. Its destruction by
the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal
reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond
might be phrased as “I will do whatever it takes to
punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of
the Last Home.”
Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical
relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay
and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt,
Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,
some indication that if his life had gone differently, he
might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he
is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond
might be phrased as “I will not rest until I have proved
myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.”
Each of these characters also has an important flaw.
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger
than her companions and annoyed that they still think
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be
tempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced that
a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity.
Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal
relationship and just wants to be left alone.
Tika and Artemis: Backgrounds
Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest
years as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid
didn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin
background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and
Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade.
Artemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving
him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency
with the tools of thievery and poison.

worst of them.
6 Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the
detriment of everything else in my life.
Acolyte
You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a
specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world,
performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to
conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You
are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is
not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasidivine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature
of your religious service. Appendix B contains a sample
pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you
a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood
to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a
high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your
god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a
small cult outside of any established temple structure, or
even an occult group that served a fiendish master that
you now deny.
Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel,
5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes,
and a pouch containing 15 gp
Feature: Shelter of the Faithful
As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who
share your faith, and you can perform the religious
ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at
a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your
faith, though you must provide any material components
needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to
serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple
where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided
the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your temple.
Suggested Characteristics
Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or
other religious communities. Their study of the history
and tenets of their faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and
ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or
heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

d8 Personality Trait
1 I always have a plan for what to do when
things go wrong.
2 I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never
raise my voice or let my emotions control me.
3 The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations
of everything valuable—or where such things
could be hidden.
4 I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.
5 I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the

5 I’m guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem
myself for it.
6 Someone I loved died because of I mistake I made. That

d6 Flaw
1 When I see something valuable, I can’t think about
anything but how to steal it.
2 When faced with a choice between money and my
friends, I usually choose the money.
3 If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it,
I’ll ignore it.
4 I have a “tell” that reveals when I’m lying.
5 I turn tail and run when things look bad.
6 An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I
committed. I’m okay with that.
Criminal
You are an experienced criminal with a history of
breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among
other criminals and still have contacts within the
criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people
to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades
the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to
this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.
Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set,
thieves’ tools
Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes
including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp
Criminal Specialty
There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves’
guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who
operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose
the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the
table below.
Feature: Criminal Contact
You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as
your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know
how to get messages to and from your contact, even over
great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can
deliver messages for you.
Suggested Characteristics
Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and
many of them are villainous to the core. But some have
an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals
rarely show any respect for law or authority.
Variant Criminal: Spy
Although your capabilities are not much different from
those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced

d6 Ideal
1 Respect. People deserve to be treated with dignity and
respect. (Good)

4 My tools are symbols of my past life, and I carry them
so that I will never forget my roots.
5 I protect those who cannot protect themselves.
6 I wish my childhood sweetheart had come with me to

Folk Hero
You come from a humble social rank, but you are
destined for so much more. Already the people of
your home village regard you as their champion, and
your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and
monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere.
Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools,
vehicles (land)
Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice),
a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, and a
pouch containing 10 gp
Defining Event
You previously pursued a simple profession among the
peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd,
woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that
set you on a different path and marked you for greater
things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event
that marked you as a hero of the people.
d10 Defining Event
1 I stood up to a tyrant’s agents.
2 I saved people during a natural disaster.
3 I stood alone against a terrible monster.
4 I stole from a corrupt merchant to help the poor.

9 A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or
revealed my secret origin.
10 Recruited into a lord’s army, I rose to leadership and
was commended for my heroism.
Feature: Rustic Hospitality
Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you
fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide,
rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you
have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will
shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you,
though they will not risk their lives for you.
Suggested Characteristics
A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for
worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as
a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities
remain very important to them.

5 In fact, the world does revolve around me.
6 By my words and actions, I often bring shame
to my family.
Noble
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry
a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes,
and wields significant political influence. You might be
a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or
a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense
of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working
landowner who cares deeply about the people who live
and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate title and determine how much authority that title carries. A
noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an
entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it
down to your own children. Not only do you need to determine your noble title, but you should also work with the
DM to describe your family and their influence on you.
Is your family old and established, or was your title only
recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield,
and over what area? What kind of reputation does your
family have among the other aristocrats of the region?
How do the common people regard them?
What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to
the head of the family? Have you already inherited the title? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you
so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what
you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How
does the head of your family feel about your adventuring
career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned
by the rest of your family?
Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you
might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your
line or even a spiritual member of the family?
These details help establish your family and your title
as features of the world of the campaign.
Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set
Languages: One of your choice
Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of
pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp
Feature: Position of Privilege
Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and
people assume you have the right to be wherever you are.
The common folk make every effort to accommodate you
and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth
treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can
secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
Suggested Characteristics
Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle
than most people ever experience, and their personalities
reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles
(including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the
family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

Sage
You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You
scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the
greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your
efforts have made you a master in your fields of study.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a
letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have
not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes,
and a pouch containing 10 gp
Specialty
To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a
d8 or choose from the options in the table below.
Feature: Researcher
When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you
do not know that information, you often know where and
from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information
comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage
or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule
that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.
Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
Suggested Characteristics
Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their
characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to
scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—
sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means
toward other ideals.

5 I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.

Soldier
War has been your life for as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons
and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including
how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been
part of a standing national army or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to
prominence during a recent war.
When you choose this background, work with your DM
to determine which military organization you were a part
of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what
kind of experiences you had during your military career.
Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia?
Or it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s private
army, or a mercenary company.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation
Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set,
vehicles (land)
Equipment: An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from
a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a
banner), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, a set of
common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp
Specialty
During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to
play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:
Feature: Military Rank
You have a military rank from your career as a soldier.
Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still
recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to
you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank
to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also
usually gain access to friendly military encampments and
fortresses where your rank is recognized.
Suggested Characteristics
The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of
military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping
their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving
them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50
feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional)
artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is
the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin
itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss
deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or
thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually
involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold
piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.
One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most
prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys
a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a
night’s rest in a poor inn.
One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are
common among laborers and beggars. A single copper
piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk.
In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum
piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from
fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes
arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a
platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces.
A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce,
so fifty coins weigh a pound.

Selling Treasure
Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment,
weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore.
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when
you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you
can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.
Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general
rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment
fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and
armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.
Magic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but
other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest
nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items,
you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to
purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold
and should always be treated as such.
Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain
their full value in the marketplace, and you can either
trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other
transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers
and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention
humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a
spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities,
almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and
practical swords.
For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons,
backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount
importance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed
wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face
of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.
Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment
based on a combination of your class and background.
Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces
based on your class and spend them on items from the
lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.
You decide how your character came by this starting
equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods
that the character purchased during his or her upbringing.
You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and
a backpack as part of military service. You might even have
stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom,
passed down from generation to generation until your
character finally took up the mantle and followed in an
ancestor’s adventurous footsteps.
Starting Wealth by Class
Class Funds
Cleric 5d4 × 10 gp
Fighter 5d4 × 10 gp
Rogue 4d4 × 10 gp
Wizard 4d4 × 10 gp
Wealth
Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins,
gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character’s financial well-being.
Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for
what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese.
Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such
as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold
bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the
coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering professional services for hire commonly deal in coins.
Coinage
Common coins come in several different denominations
based on the relative worth of the metal from which they
are made. The three most common coins are the gold
piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp).

Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in
the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is
carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your
Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield
at a time.
Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors
agile adventurers since it offers some protection without
sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your
Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor
type to determine your Armor Class.
Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of
cloth and batting.
Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of
this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by
being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer
and more flexible materials.
Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets
or spikes.
DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or
larger community first.
Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art
objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock,
and so on—retain their full value in the market and can
be used as currency.
Armor and Shields
D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For
this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to
costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in
between. The Armor table collects the most commonly
available types of armor found in the game and separates
them into three categories: light armor, medium armor,
and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor
with a shield.
The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other
properties of the common types of armor worn in the
worlds of D&D.
Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor
or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the
armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however.
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of
armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with,
you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw,
or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
can’t cast spells.
Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your
base Armor Class.
Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the
Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength
column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength
score equal to or higher than the listed score.
Armor

Chain mail 75 gp 16 Str 13 Disadvantage 55 lb.
Splint 200 gp 17 Str 15 Disadvantage 60 lb.
Plate 1,500 gp 18 Str 15 Disadvantage 65 lb.
Shield
Shield 10 gp +2 — — 6 lb.
Variant: Equipment Sizes
In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment
that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of
common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won’t fit in a
halfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed
up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe.
The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit
of plate armor made for one human might not fit another
one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform
might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it
as a disguise.
Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,
and similar items that are made to be worn, they might
need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar
expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work
varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item.
The DM can either roll 1d4 × 10 or determine the increase
in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.

Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely
to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your
weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean
the difference between life and death while adventuring.
The Weapons table shows the most common weapons
used in the worlds of D&D, their price and weight, the
damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either
melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a
target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is
used to attack a target at a distance.
Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency
with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two
categories are simple and martial. Most people can
use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons
include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in
the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including
swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized
training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial
weapons because these weapons put their fighting style
and training to best use.
Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make
with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a
weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add
your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.
Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use,
as shown in the Weapons table.
Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you
have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you
attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or
other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand
to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle,
you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to
make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised
weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section).
A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used
in this way.
Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use
the same modifier for both rolls.
Medium Armor
Medium armor offers more protection than light armor,
but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium
armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum
of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.
Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.
It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids,
and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials
needed to create better armor.
Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain
shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This
armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper
body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against
one another to be muffled by outer layers.
Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with
overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a
fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest
piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the
legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides
good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.
Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates
that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached
with leather straps.
Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best
protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body
and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only
proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.
Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you
if your Dexterity modifier is negative.
Ring Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy
rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor
against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior
to chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those who
can’t afford better armor.
Chain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain
mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath
the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of
blows. The suit includes gauntlets.
Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips
of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over
cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.
Plate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal
plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes
gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and
thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles
and straps distribute the weight over the body.
Getting Into and Out of Armor
The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield
is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table.
Don. This is the time it takes to put on the item. You
benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it.
Doff. This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you
have help removing armor, reduce this time by half.

ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two
numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in
feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range.
When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have
disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target
beyond the weapon’s long range.
Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when
you attack with it, as well as when determining your
reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9).
Special. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s
description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).
Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size
and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use
effectively.
Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See
the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9.
Loading. Because of the time required to load this
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from
it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to
fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged
attack has a range shown in parentheses after the

Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or
require further explanation.
Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this
vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial
up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make
a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the
acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes
2d6 acid damage.
Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites
when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this
flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged
attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target
takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A
creature can end this damage by using its action to make
a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid
gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1
hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.
Arcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item—an
orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wandlike length of wood, or some similar item—designed to
channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock,
or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as
described in chapter 10.
Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny
metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area
that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the
covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area
at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw.
Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable
threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a
block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the
weight you can normally lift.
Book. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of
lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just
about anything else that can be represented using text or
pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later
in this section).
Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a single bag
of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature
that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its
walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving
through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the
saving throw.
Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a
5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to
twenty crossbow bolts.
Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can
hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up
sheets of parchment.
Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a
successful DC 20 Strength check.
Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons,
boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you
Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon
is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for
that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a
melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw
a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity,
since the dagger has the finesse property.
Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when
you attack with it.
Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the
property—the damage when the weapon is used with two
hands to make a melee attack.
Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have
to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised
weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two
hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a
wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.
In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an
actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a
table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character
proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it
were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.
An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals
1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon
to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that
does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.
Silvered Weapons
Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to
nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons,
so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their
weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or
ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents
not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise
needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less
effective.
Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.
Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to
attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires
two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.
Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures
that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger.
A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach
on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC
10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the
effect and destroying the net.
When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless
of the number of attacks you can normally make.

 Chapter 5: Equipment
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light
in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.
Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As
an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to
dim light in a 5-foot radius.
Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key,
a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may
decide that better locks are available for higher prices.
Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at
small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and
steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus,
tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite.
A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check
made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or
highly detailed.
Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small
or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them
requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each
set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key,
a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the
manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity
check. Manacles have 15 hit points.
can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you
anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet
away from that point without undoing the anchor.
Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold
all the material components and other special items you
need to cast your spells, except for those components that
have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).
Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength
checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.
Druidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another
special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a
totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth
from sacred animals. A druid (see chapter 3 of the Player’s
Handbook) can use such an object as a spellcasting focus,
as described in chapter 10.
Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken
line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet
lures, and narrow netting.
Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing
bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As
an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a
creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a
Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of
a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a
symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully
engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box
holding a fragment of a sacred relic. The Player’s Handbook lists many gods in the multiverse and their typical
symbols. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10. To use the
symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear
it visibly, or bear it on a shield.
Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents
of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case,
make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating
the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a
fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing
a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses
25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to
expend a 1st-level spell slot.
Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this
trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when
a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The
trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object,
such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and
stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free
of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the
chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action
to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another
creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check
deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.
Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6
hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.
Equipment Packs
The starting equipment you get from your class includes
a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a
pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are
buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack
for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying
the items individually.
Burglar’s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of
1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a
crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of
oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack
also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.
Diplomat’s Pack (39 gp). Includes a chest, 2 cases for
maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an
ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of
perfume, sealing wax, and soap.
Dungeoneer’s Pack (12 gp). Includes a backpack, a
crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10
days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet
of hempen rope strapped to the side of it.
Entertainer’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll,
2 costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a
disguise kit.
Explorer’s Pack (10 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll,
a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and
a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope
strapped to the side of it.
Priest’s Pack (19 gp). Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10
candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a
censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin.
Scholar’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a book of
lore, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a
little bag of sand, and a small knife.

Tools
A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or
pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give
you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability
check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to
a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might
ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail
with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to
make something out of particularly hard wood.
Artisan’s Tools. These special tools include the items
needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing
items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set
of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus
to any ability checks you make using the tools in your
craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate
proficiency.
Disguise Kit. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and
small props lets you create disguises that change your
physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you
add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you
make to create a visual disguise.

Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used
as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.
Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint.
As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a
creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet,
shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a
target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised
weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target
takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the
burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground
to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface
is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire
damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its
turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only
once per turn.
Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial
to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three
pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an
action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.
Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical
red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking
or administering a potion takes an action.
Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling
bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A
compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components
is called a component pouch (described earlier in this
section).
Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.
Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break
down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the
Strength check. One other character can help you use the
ram, giving you advantage on this check.
Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for
extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.
Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit
points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.
Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to
2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight
of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade
goods, to help determine their worth.
Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a
leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable
for recording spells.
Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.
Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent
sleeps two.
Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel,
and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to
kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else
with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting
any other fire takes 1 minute.
Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it
deals 1 fire damage.

instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a
separate proficiency.
Navigator’s Tools. This set of instruments is used for
navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets
you chart a ship’s course and follow navigation charts.
In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency
bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting
lost at sea.
Poisoner’s Kit. A poisoner’s kit includes the vials,
chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add
your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to
craft or use poisons.
Thieves’ Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a
set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.
Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency
bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or
open locks.
Mounts and Vehicles
A good mount can help you move more quickly through
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts
and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and
base carrying capacity.
An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or
wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying
capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple
animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.
Mounts other than those listed here are available in the
worlds of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi,
griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even
aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring
such a mount often means securing an egg and raising
the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful
entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.
Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an
animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor
shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent
armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.
Saddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you
keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you
advantage on any check you make to remain mounted.
An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or
flying mount.
Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a
certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your
proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that
kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances.
Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on
lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of
the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the
vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft
animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in
case adventurers carry it over land.

Expenses
When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the
encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane
realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic
necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing.
These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost
more than others.
Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover
your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other
necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of
maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when
adventure next calls.
At the start of each week or month (your choice),
choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the
price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per
day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen
lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price
by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the
next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you
might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.
Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts
with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you
avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful
connections.

Trade Goods
Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock,
grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources
(such as a mine or a forest).
Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered
companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to
buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods
or services that they control, and determine who may
or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants
commonly exchange trade goods without using currency.
The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly exchanged goods.

Services
Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them
or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are
masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.
Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the
Services table. Other common hirelings include any of
the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or
city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific
task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for
use in the Leomund’s secret chest spell. A fighter might
commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard
might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.
Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous
services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages
hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level
adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or
she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run
the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers
to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a
Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no
place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the
good graces of people better off than you. A wretched
lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease,
and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched
people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear,
which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.
Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut
just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house
in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the
elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and
misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at
this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback.
They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer
from disease.
Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and
lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant,
experience. Your accommodations might be a room in
a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You
benefit from some legal protections, but you still have
to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at
this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other
disreputable types.
Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums
and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You
live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding
house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and
your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families,
laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.
Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means
that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain
your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn.
You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and
military officers.
Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a
life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the
social status associated with the old money of nobility or
royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly
successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or
the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of
town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a
small staff of servants.
Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You
move in circles populated by the most powerful people
in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps
a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the
finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants
attending to your every need. You receive invitations to
the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend
evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders,
high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the
highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon,
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The
pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require
more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work
that requires no particular skill and can include laborers,
porters, maids, and similar workers.
Spellcasting Services
People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find
someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or
favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates
exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell,
the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the
more it costs.
Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of
1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy
enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold
pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a
higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city,
perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once
found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of
payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can
provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous
locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.
Self-Sufficiency
The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter
assume that you are spending your time between
adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services
you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying
townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor,
and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend
their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in
the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.
Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to
spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend
your time between adventures practicing a profession, as
described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at
the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

 Chapter 6: Customization Options
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Chapter 6: Customization Options
The combination of ability scores, race, class, and
background defines your character’s capabilities in the
game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your
class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your
character can do. But a few players—with the DM’s permission—want to go a step further.
Chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook defines two
optional sets of rules for customizing your character:
multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine
classes together, and feats are special options you can
choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you
gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are
available in a campaign.
Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those
classes to realize a character concept that might not be
reflected in one of the standard class options.
With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level
in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead
of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all
your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard
and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character.
As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain
a member of your original class with just a few levels in
another class, or you might change course entirely, never
looking back at the class you left behind. You might even
start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to
a single-class character of the same level, you’ll sacrifice
some focus in exchange for versatility.
Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score
prerequisites for both your current class and your new
one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table
in the Player’s Handbook. Without the full training that
a beginning character receives, you must be a quick
study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that
is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.
Experience Points
The experience point cost to gain a level is always based
on your total character level, as shown in the Character
Advancement table in chapter 1 of this document, not
your level in a particular class.
Hit Points and Hit Dice
You gain the hit points from your new class as described
for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a
class only when you are a 1st-level character.
You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are
the same die type, you can simply pool them together.
If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep
track of them separately.
Proficiency Bonus
Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total
character level, as shown in the Character Advancement
table, not your level in a particular class.
Proficiencies
When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you
gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies. See
chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.
Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features
for that level. A few features, however, have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. See chapter 6 of the
Player’s Handbook for more information.
Feats
A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives
a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. See
chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information.
At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score
Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice
instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the
feat’s description says otherwise.
You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to
take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you
can’t use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Six abilities provide a quick description of every
creature’s physical and mental characteristics:
Strength, measuring physical power
Dexterity, measuring agility
Constitution, measuring endurance
Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory
Wisdom, measuring perception and insight
Charisma, measuring force of personality
Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and
charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these
qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.
The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the
saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability
scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule
behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the
total to a target number.
This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and
saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that
creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.
Ability Scores and
Modifiers
Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that
defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is
not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities
related to that ability.
A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but
adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average
in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high
as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as
high as 30.
Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score
and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for
a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table
notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability
scores, from 1 to 30.
To determine an ability modifier without consulting the
table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide
the total by 2 (round down).
Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack
roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers
come up in play more often than their associated scores.
Advantage and
Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you
have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a
saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher
of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower
roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have
disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you
instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you
use the 17.
If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants
advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll
more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.
If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage
and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.
When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets
you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace
only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example,
if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability
check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the
Lucky trait to reroll the 1.
You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration
can also give a character advantage (as explained in
chapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can
also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one
direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.
Proficiency Bonus
Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level,
as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus,
which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is
used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and
attack rolls.
Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die
roll or other number more than once. For example, if two
different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to
a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus
only once when you make the save.
Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before
you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature
doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks.
If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus

applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it
only once and multiply or divide it only once.
By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to
multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability
check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check.
For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact
that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if
you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency
bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.
In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for
attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows
you to do so, these same rules apply.
Ability Checks
An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate
talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.
The DM calls for an ability check when a character or
monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that
has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine the results.
For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six
abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty
of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty
Classes table shows the most common DCs.
Typical Difficulty Classes
Task Difficulty DC
Very easy 5
Easy 10
Medium 15
Hard 20
Very hard 25
Nearly impossible 30
To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply
bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC.
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check
is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at
hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective
or makes progress combined with a setback determined
by the DM.
Contests
Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both
of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can
succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring
that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies
when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from
accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries
to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed.
In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a
special form of ability check, called a contest.
Both participants in a contest make ability checks
appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate
bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total
to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The
participant with the higher check total wins the contest.
That character or monster either succeeds at the action
or prevents the other one from succeeding.
If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the
same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant
might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in
a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character
grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open
a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed,
a tie means that the door remains shut.
Skills
Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient
in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score,
and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates
a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a
monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s
stat block.)
For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an
object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand,
and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
checks related to sneaking and hiding.
The skills related to each ability score are shown in
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)
See an ability’s description in the later sections of this
chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated
with an ability.
Strength
Athletics
Dexterity
Acrobatics
Sleight of Hand
Stealth
Intelligence
Arcana
History
Investigation
Nature
Religion
Wisdom
Animal Handling
Insight
Medicine
Perception
Survival
Charisma
Deception
Intimidation
Performance
Persuasion
Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check
using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the
DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check.
In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual
can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that
involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.
For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength
(Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the
Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he
or she just makes a Strength check.

Variant: Skills with Different Abilities
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a
specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics,
for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably
apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM
might ask for a check using an unusual combination of
ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you
have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland,
your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you
have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your
DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics
and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re
proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to
the Constitution check just as you would normally do for
a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your dwarf
fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an
enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation)
check, even though Intimidation is normally associated
with Charisma.
Passive Checks
A passive check is a special kind of ability check that
doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent
the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as
searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be
used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether
the characters succeed at something without rolling dice,
such as noticing a hidden monster.
Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:
10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check
If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For
disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive
check total as a score.
For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of
15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive
Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.
The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below
rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in
chapter 8.
Working Together
Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a
task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one
with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability
check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the
other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action
(see chapter 9).
A character can only provide help if the task is one that
he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open
a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character
in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two
or more individuals working together would actually be
productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no
easier with help.
Group Checks
When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish
something as a group, the DM might ask for a group
ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are
skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.
To make a group ability check, everyone in the group
makes the ability check. If at least half the group
succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the
group fails.
Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re
most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a
group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a
swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival)
check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand,
sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.
If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger.
Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.
Using Each Ability
Every task that a character or monster might attempt
in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This
section explains in more detail what those abilities mean
and the ways they are used in the game.
Strength
Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and
the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.
Strength Checks
A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push,
pull, or break something, to force your body through a
space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.
The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of
Strength checks.
Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers
difficult situations you encounter while climbing,
jumping, or swimming. Examples include the
following activities:
• You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid
hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while
something is trying to knock you off.
• You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull
off a stunt midjump.
• You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed.
Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.
Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for
a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
• Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
• Break free of bonds
• Push through a tunnel that is too small
• Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
• Tip over a statue
• Keep a boulder from rolling

Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and
your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon
such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a
ranged attack.
Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength score determines the amount of weight
you can bear. The following terms define what you can
lift or carry.
Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your
Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that
most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.
Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight
in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times
your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight
in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops
to 5 feet.
Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more
weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each
size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For
a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
Variant: Encumbrance
The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed
rules for determining how a character is hindered by the
weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore
the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5.
If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength
score, you are encumbered, which means your speed
drops by 10 feet.
If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength
score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are
instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed
drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution.
Dexterity
Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.
Dexterity Checks
A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly,
quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills
reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.
Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers
your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such
as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance
on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck.
The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check
to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including
dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.
Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something
on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM
might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to
determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another
person or slip something out of another
person’s pocket.
Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you
attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past
guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on
someone without being seen or heard.
Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a
Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
• Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
• Steer a chariot around a tight turn
• Pick a lock
• Disable a trap
• Securely tie up a prisoner
• Wriggle free of bonds
• Play a stringed instrument
• Craft a small or detailed object
Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and
your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon,
such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse
property, such as a dagger or a rapier.
Hiding
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for
hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth)
check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that
check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception)
check of any creature that actively searches for signs of
your presence.
You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly,
and you give away your position if you make noise, such as
shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible
creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of
its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has
to stay quiet.
In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger
all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach
a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain
circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to
stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted,
allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before
you are seen.
Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance
someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To
determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM
compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the
creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses
or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For
disadvantage, subtract 5.
For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency
bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom
(Perception) of 14.
What Can You See? One of the main factors in
determining whether you can find a hidden creature or
object is how well you can see in an area, which might be
lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8.
64
 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Armor Class
Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some
or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class,
as described in chapter 5.
Initiative
At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by
making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order
of creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9.
Constitution
Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.
Constitution Checks
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply
to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a
specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A
Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.
The DM might call for a Constitution check when you
try to accomplish tasks like the following:
• Hold your breath
• March or labor for hours without rest
• Go without sleep
• Survive without food or water
• Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go
Hit Points
Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points.
Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit
Die you roll for your hit points.
If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point
maximum changes as well, as though you had the new
modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your
Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had
always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first
three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level
using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some
effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your
Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is
reduced by 7.
Intelligence
Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall,
and the ability to reason.
Intelligence Checks
An Intelligence check comes into play when you need
to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and
Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.
Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures
your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items,
eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.
History. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events,
legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.
Investigation. When you look around for clues and
make deductions based on those clues, you make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the
location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance
of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the
weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.
Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden
fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence
(Investigation) check.
Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures
your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.
Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures
your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,
religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices
of secret cults.
Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an
Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
• Communicate with a creature without using words
• Estimate the value of a precious item
• Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
• Forge a document
• Recall lore about a craft or trade
• Win a game of skill
Spellcasting Ability
Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability,
which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells
they cast.
Wisdom
Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around
you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.
Wisdom Checks
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body
language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things
about the environment, or care for an injured person.
The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and
Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.
Animal Handling. When there is any question whether
you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount
Finding a Hidden Object
When your character searches for a hidden object such as
a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make
a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to
find hidden details or other information and clues that you
might otherwise overlook.
In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking
in order for the DM to determine your chance of success.
For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes
in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you
pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for
clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of
your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to
specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the
bureau in order to have any chance of success.
65
 Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the
DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.
You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.
Insight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether
you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such
as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next
move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.
Medicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to
stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.
Perception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you
spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.
It measures your general awareness of
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses.
For example, you might try to hear a conversation through
a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear
monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try
to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether
they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in
the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed
secret door.
Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom
(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide
your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that
owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.
Other Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a
Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
• Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
• Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead
Spellcasting Ability
Clerics use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which
helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
Charisma
Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively
with others. It includes such factors as confidence and
eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.
Charisma Checks
A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence
or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating
a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation,
Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
certain kinds of Charisma checks.
Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either
verbally or through your actions. This deception can
encompass everything from misleading others through
ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn
money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise,
dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.
Intimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical
violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs
to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of
a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.
Performance. Your Charisma (Performance) check
determines how well you can delight an audience with
music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of
entertainment.
Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone
or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good
nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma
(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when
acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial
requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let
your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.
Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a
Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like
the following:
• Find the best person to talk to for news,
rumors, and gossip
• Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics
of conversation
Spellcasting Ability
Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma
as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the
saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or
a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a
saving throw; you are forced to make one because your
character or monster is at risk of harm.
To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your
Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.
A saving throw can be modified by a situational
bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage
and disadvantage, as determined by the DM.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a
saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score.
Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by
the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving
throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s
spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.
The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also
detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or
reduced harm, from an effect.

 Chapter 8: Adventuring
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Movement
Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all
sorts of movement play a key role in D&D adventures.
The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement
without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You
travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance
late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon,
particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM
can summarize movement between encounters: “After
killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you
through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by
a narrow stone arch.”
Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it
takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer
is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining
travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel
pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re
moving over.
Speed
Every character and monster has a speed, which is the
distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in
1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic
movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.
The following rules determine how far a character
or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.
Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a
normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace
table. The table states how far the party can move in a
period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast
pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area
more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section
later in this chapter for more information).
Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that
characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.
For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours,
the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour
column for their pace, and each character must make a
Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC
is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving
throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see
appendix A).
Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an
hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids.
A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an
hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If
fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters
can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very
rare except in densely populated areas.
Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles
choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne
vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see chapter
Delving into the ancient Tomb of Horrors, slipping
through the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh
trail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these
are the things that Dungeons & Dragons adventures
are made of. Your character in the game might explore
forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if
all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich
rewards before embarking on a new adventure.
This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life,
from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of
social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this
chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your
character might pursue between adventures.
Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon
or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game
follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s
introduction:
1. The DM describes the environment.
2. The players describe what they want to do.
3. The DM narrates the results of their actions.
Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore
dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s
notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes,
the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a
flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.
Time
In situations where keeping track of the passage of time
is important, the DM determines the time a task requires.
The DM might use a different time scale depending on
the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale
of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down
a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on
the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes
to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting
or valuable.
In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more
appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower
at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles
in just under four hours’ time.
For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the
adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin
ambush interrupts their journey.
In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game
relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in
chapter 9.

5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and
the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to
24 hours per day.
Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon,
or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you
to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide contains more information on special methods of travel.
Travel Pace
Pace
 Distance Traveled per . . .
Minute Hour Day Effect
Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles −5 penalty to
passive Wisdom
(Perception) scores
Normal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles —
Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles Able to use stealth
Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume
relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests,
deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and
ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.
You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving
1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you
can cover only half the normal distance in a minute,
an hour, or a day.
Special Types of Movement
Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness
areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get
where they need to go.
Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet
in difficult terrain) when you’re climbing, swimming, or
crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing
speed and use it to climb or a swimming speed and use it
to swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical
surface or one with few handholds requires a successful
Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength
(Athletics) check.
Jumping
Your Strength determines how far you can jump.
Long Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at
least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half
that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump
costs a foot of movement.
This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t
matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At
your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength
(Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a
quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low
wall. Otherwise, you hit it.
When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on
a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet.
Otherwise, you land prone.
High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap
into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength
modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet
on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a
standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance.
Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of
movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow
you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher
than you normally can.
You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a
distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times
your height.
Activity While Traveling
As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wilderness, they need to remain alert for danger, and
some characters might perform other tasks to help
the group’s journey.
Marching Order
The adventurers should establish a marching order. A
marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden
enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when a fight breaks out.
A character might occupy the front rank, one or more
middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front
and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side
with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the
marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.
Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they
are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank,
it’s considered a front rank.
Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move
stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.
See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.
Splitting Up the Party
Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party,
especially if you want one or more characters to scout
ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a
different speed. Each group has its own front, middle,
and back ranks.
The drawback to this approach is that the party will be
split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack.
The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters
moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that
clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at
a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their
dwarf fighter friend behind.

 Chapter 8: Adventuring
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Noticing Threats
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the group notices
a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can
be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels,
the DM might decide that only those characters in the
back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature following the group, while characters in the front
and middle ranks cannot.
While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a –5
penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
to notice hidden threats.
Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines that
the adventurers encounter other creatures while they’re
traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens
next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a
conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other
group does.
Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile
creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat
erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.
Other Activities
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the
group travels are not focused on watching for danger.
These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom
(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing
hidden threats. However, a character not watching for
danger can do one of the following activities instead, or
some other activity with the DM’s permission.
Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group
from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check
when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide
has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)
Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that
records the group’s progress and helps the characters
get back on course if they get lost. No ability check
is required.
Track. A character can follow the tracks of another
creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the
DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide has rules
for tracking.)
Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready
sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival)
check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master’s
Guide has rules for foraging.)
The Environment
By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places
that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most
important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide
has rules covering more unusual situations.
Falling
A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer.
At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.
The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage
from the fall.
Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of
30 seconds).
When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can
survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution
modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next
turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.
For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can
hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has
2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing
danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily
on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects
that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.
A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a
lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or
moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque
fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix
A) when trying to see something in that area.
The presence or absence of light in an environment
creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim
light, and darkness.
Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even
gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns,
fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.
Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary
between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn
also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon
might bathe the land in dim light.
Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit
nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
Blindsight
A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with
echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true
dragons, have this sense.
Darkvision
Many creatures in the worlds of D&D, especially those
that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light
as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim
light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far
as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

 Chapter 8: Adventuring
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Truesight
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range,
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them,
and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a
creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore,
the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.
Food and Water
Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of
exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack
of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats
and drinks the full required amount.
Food
A character needs one pound of food per day and can
make food last longer by subsisting on half rations.
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day
without food.
A character can go without food for a number of days
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum
1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character
automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.
 A normal day of eating resets the count of days without
food to zero.
Water
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks
only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at
the end of the day. A character with access to even less
water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the
end of the day.
If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
Interacting with Objects
A character’s interaction with objects in an environment
is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the
DM that his or her character is doing something, such
as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything, happens.
For example, a character might decide to pull a lever,
which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to
flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If
the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might
need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call
for a Strength check to see whether the character can
wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any
such check based on the difficulty of the task.
Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and
psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by
physical and magical attacks much like creatures can.
The DM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit
points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard
to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always
fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are
immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.
A character can also attempt a Strength check to break
an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.
Social Interaction
Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less
important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.
Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to
convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it
will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any
characters who are participating in the interaction that
don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).
In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs
are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined
to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want from a
friendly NPC, of course.
Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.
Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In
this case, it’s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.
Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it
comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how
interactions resolve.
There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your
character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles.
Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.
Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
With this approach, you describe your character’s words
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on
your mental image of your character, you tell everyone
what your character does and how he or she does it.
For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has
a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood
for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf
minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.
Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult
at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool
and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.”
In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood
and given the DM a clear idea of his character’s attitude
and actions.
When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following
things in mind:
• Describe your character’s emotions and attitude.
• Focus on your character’s intent and how others
might perceive it.
• Provide as much embellishment as you feel
comfortable with.
70
 Chapter 8: Adventuring
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and
describing what you see in your mind.
Active Approach to Roleplaying
If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow
players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.
When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your
character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might
even echo your character’s movements and body language.
This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that
can’t be reasonably acted out.
Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek
above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used
active roleplaying:
Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,
“I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here.
If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm
and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then
adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.”
Results of Roleplaying
The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to
determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles
under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let
anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to
the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and
personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s
personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on
them to influence the NPC’s attitude.
Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real
life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten
them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything
you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior
or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or
deceive will fall short.
Ability Checks
In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.
Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but
there might still be an element of chance in the situation.
For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at
any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice
to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other
checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your
DM’s discretion.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking
of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the
deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on
your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a
guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion.
When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with
Persuasion should do most of the talking.
Resting
Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend
every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and
eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for
spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.
Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short
rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.
Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long,
during which a character does nothing more strenuous
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.
A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of
Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each
Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds
the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character
regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The
player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after
each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon
finishing a long rest, as explained below.
Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8
hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least
6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or
similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin
the rest again to gain any benefit from it.
At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost
hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up
to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total
number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a
character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four
spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.
A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest
in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.
Between Adventures
Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting
arms and armor, performing research, or spending
their hard-earned gold.
In some cases, the passage of time is something that
occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a
new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe
in general terms what your character has
been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep
track of just how much time is passing as events beyond
your perception stay in motion.

D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Lifestyle Expenses
Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of
life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.
Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect
on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way
other individuals and groups react to you. For example,
when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier
for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live
in poverty.
Downtime Activities
Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your
character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods
of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime
activity requires a certain number of days to complete
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day
to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you
have more than the minimum amount of days to spend,
you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period
of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.
Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his
or her downtime performing an activity not covered here,
discuss it with your DM.
Crafting
You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient
with tools related to the object you are trying to create
(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to
special materials or locations necessary to create it. For
example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a
forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.
For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can
craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth
half the total market value. If something you want to craft
has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress
every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market
value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.
Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward
the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are
working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to
craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a
suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.
While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle
without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable
lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more
information on lifestyle expenses).
Practicing a Profession
You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day
(see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).
This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your
profession.
If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’
guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.
If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put
your performance skill to use during your downtime, you
earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.
Recuperating
You can use downtime between adventures to recover
from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.
After three days of downtime spent recuperating,
you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
On a successful save, you can choose one of the
following results:
• End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.
• For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws
against one disease or poison currently
affecting you.
Researching
The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have
unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can
include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls
in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors
and gossip from their lips.
When you begin your research, the DM determines
whether the information is available, how many days of
downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any
restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out
a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might
also require you to make one or more ability checks,
such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues
pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma
(Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those
conditions are met, you learn the information if it is
available.
For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover
your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal
lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).
Training
You can spend time between adventures learning a new
language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might
allow additional training options.
First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you.
The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one
or more ability checks are required.
The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day.
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money,
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with
the new tool.

 Chapter 9: Combat
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
The clatter of a sword striking against a shield.
The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear
through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame
blossoms from a wizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood
in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters.
Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in
D&D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling.
This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is
a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or
on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon
Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer characters involved in combat, and each other player controls an
adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or monster that you control.
The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides,
a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and
spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat
into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents
about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each
participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when
everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn,
the fight continues to the next round if neither side has
defeated the other.
Surprise
A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp,
springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous
cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the
adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these
situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over
the other.
The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice
each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity
(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing
side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a
threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.
If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action
on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be
surprised even if the other members aren’t.
Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat.
When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity
check to determine their place in the initiative order. The
DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.
The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one
with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with
the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order)
in which they act during each round. The initiative order
remains the same from round to round.
If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied
DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The DM can decide the
order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and
monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest
roll going first.
Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed
and take one action. You decide whether to move first or
take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your
walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.
The most common actions you can take are described
in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter.
Many class features and other abilities provide additional
options for your action.
The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.
You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on
your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as
described in “Actions in Combat.”
Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a
rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action
only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the
game states that you can do something as a bonus action.
You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.
You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you
must choose which bonus action to use when you have
more than one available.
You choose when to take a bonus action during your
turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and
anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions
also prevents you from taking a bonus action.
Chapter 9: Combat
Combat Step by Step
1.Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone
involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
2.Establish positions. The DM decides where all the
characters and monsters are located. Given the
adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in
the room or other location, the DM figures out where the
adversaries are—how far away and in what direction.
3.Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of
combatants’ turns.
4.Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
initiative order.
5.Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4
until the fighting stops.

Other Activity on Your Turn
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require
neither your action nor your move.
You can communicate however you are able, through
brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.
You can also interact with one object or feature of the
environment for free, during either your move or your
action. For example, you could open a door during your
move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your
weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.
If you want to interact with a second object, you need
to use your action. Some magic items and other special
objects always require an action to use, as stated
in their descriptions.
The DM might require you to use an action for any
of these activities when it needs special care or when it
presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM
could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you
to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is
an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can
occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity
attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type of reaction.
When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one
until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts
another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its
turn right after the reaction.
Movement and Position
In combat, characters and monsters are in constant
motion, often using movement and position to gain the
upper hand.
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as
you like on your turn, following the rules here.
Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and
swimming. These different modes of movement can be
combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire
move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of
each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.
The “Special Types of Movement” section in chapter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing,
and swimming.
Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your movement on your turn, using
some of your speed before and after your action. For
example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.
Moving between Attacks
If you take an action that includes more than one weapon
attack, you can break up your movement even further by
moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter
who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature
and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make
an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.
Using Different Speeds
If you have more than one speed, such as your walking
speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth
between your speeds during your move. Whenever you
switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from
the new speed. The result determines how much farther
you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the
new speed during the current move.
For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying
speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you,
you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into
the air to fly 30 feet more.
Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked
forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of
a typical fight contains difficult terrain.
Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1
extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in
a space count as difficult terrain.
Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow,
and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The
space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also
counts as difficult terrain.
Being Prone
Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground,
either because they are knocked down or because they
throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone,
a condition described in appendix A.
You can drop prone without using any of your speed.
Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet
Interacting with Objects Around You
Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in
tandem with your movement and action:
• draw or sheathe a sword
• open or close a door
• withdraw a potion from your backpack
• pick up a dropped axe
• take a bauble from a table
• remove a ring from your finger
• stuff some food into your mouth
• plant a banner in the ground
• fish a few coins from your belt pouch
• drink all the ale in a flagon
• throw a lever or a switch
• pull a torch from a sconce
• take a book from a shelf you can reach
• extinguish a small flame
• don a mask
• pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head
• put your ear to a door
• kick a small stone
• turn a key in a lock
• tap the floor with a 10-foot pole
• hand an item to another character

of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t
have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.
To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while
crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.
Moving Around Other Creatures
You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In
contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space
only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller
than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.
Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t
willingly end your move in its space.
If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move,
you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in
the chapter.
Flying Movement
Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but
they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying
creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or
is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature
falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held
aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.
Creature Size
Each creature takes up a different amount of space.
The Size Categories table shows how much space
a creature of a particular size controls in combat.
Objects sometimes use the same size categories.
Size Categories
Size Space Example Monsters
Tiny 2½ by 2½ ft. Imp, sprite
Small 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin
Medium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf
Large 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre
Huge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant
Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger Kraken, purple worm
Space
A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively
controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide,
for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a
Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway,
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin
lets them.
A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight
effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number
of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can
fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.
Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer
of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures
crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little
room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.
Squeezing into a Smaller Space
A creature can squeeze through a space that is large
enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a
Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only
5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature
must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and
it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving
throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage
while it’s in the smaller space.
Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one
of the actions presented here, an action you gained from
your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own
in their stat blocks.
When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack
action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.
With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.
See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.
Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature
of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack
with this action.
Variant: Playing on a Grid
If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures
or other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by
square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot
segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your
speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example,
a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in
squares on your character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have
at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square
is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule
for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of
smooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance
on using a more realistic approach.)
If a square costs extra movement, as a square of
difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement
left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have
at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of
difficult terrain.
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a
wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two
things—whether creatures or objects—start counting
squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop
counting in the space of the other one. Count by the
shortest route.

 Chapter 9: Combat
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Cast a Spell
Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many
monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great
effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which
specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a
spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells
do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often
uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See
chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting.
Dash
When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your
speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30
feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn
if you dash.
Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this
additional movement by the same amount. If your speed
of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move
up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.
Disengage
If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.
Dodge
When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on
avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any
attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws
with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed
drops to 0.
Help
You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the
creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability
check it makes to perform the task you are helping with,
provided that it makes the check before the start of your
next turn.
Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract
the target, or in some other way team up to make your
ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target
before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with
advantage.
Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity
(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules
in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain
benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.
Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a
particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can
take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.
First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will
trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you
will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to
move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I
move away.”
When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.
Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.
When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold
its energy, which you release with your reaction when the
trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic
requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your
concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the
web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends,
and if you take damage before you release magic missile
with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.
Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your
attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a
Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Use an Object
You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an
attack. When an object requires your action for its use,
you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object
on your turn.
Making an Attack
Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a
weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a
spell, an attack has a simple structure.
1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s
range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether
the target has cover and whether you have advantage
or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells,
Improvising an Action
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in
this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating
enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or
calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions
you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s
ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in
chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise.
When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine
success or failure.
76
 Chapter 9: Combat

special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties
or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit,
you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules
that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special
effects in addition to or instead of damage.
If there’s ever any question whether something you’re
doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re
making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.
Attack Rolls
When you make an attack, your attack roll determines
whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll,
roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total
of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s
Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character
is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a
monster is in its stat block.
Modifiers to the Roll
When a character makes an attack roll, the two most
common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier
and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster
makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.
Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee
weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used
for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that
have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.
Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability
modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10.
Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus
to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with
which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack
with a spell.
Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called
a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter.
If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC.
Unseen Attackers and Targets
Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.
When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have
disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether
you’re guessing the target’s location or you’re targeting a
creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the
location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM
typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you
guessed the target’s location correctly.
When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on
attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when
you make an attack, you give away your location when the
attack hits or misses.
Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a
crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot
spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.
Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within
a specified range.
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a
single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number
is the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target
is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.
Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a
weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile
creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.
Melee Attacks
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you
to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically
uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack
when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or
other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.
Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee
attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than
Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5
feet, as noted in their descriptions.
Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon
attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick,
head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count
as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are
proficient with your unarmed strikes.
Opportunity Attacks
In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies
to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so
provokes an opportunity attack.
You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile
creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To
make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction
to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves
your reach.
You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by
taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an
opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone
or something moves you without using your movement,
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an
77

cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the
target has three-quarters cover.
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and
Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might
be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree
trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy
or a friend.
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to
AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an
obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow
slit, or a thick tree trunk.
A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by
an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such
a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has
total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
Damage and Healing
Injury and the risk of death are constant companions
of those who explore the worlds of D&D. The thrust of
a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a
fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill,
the hardiest of creatures.
Hit Points
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with
more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with
fewer hit points are more fragile.
A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit
points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point
maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as
a creature takes damage or receives healing.
Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is
subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has
no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature
drops to 0 hit points.
Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice,
add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target.
Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can
grant a bonus to damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability
modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to
the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.
If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than
one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all
of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a
opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.
Two-Weapon Fighting
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light
melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can
use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee
weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t
add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.
If either weapon has the thrown property, you can
throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.
Grappling
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you
can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack,
a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the
Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
The target of your grapple must be no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target
by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check
contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use).
You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If
you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things
that end it, and you can release the target whenever you
like (no action required).
Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by
your Strength (Athletics) check.
Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more
sizes smaller than you.
Shoving a Creature
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push
it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks
with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.
The target of your shove must be no more than one
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.
You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by
the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You
succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If
you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push
it 5 feet away from you.
Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide
cover during combat, making a target more difficult
to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of
the cover.
There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind
multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree
of cover applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For
example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half
Contests in Combat
Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of
your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This
section includes the most common contests that require an
action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM
can use these contests as models for improvising others.

Damage Resistance and
Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or
unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.
If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage
type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type,
damage of that type is doubled against it.
Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all
other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has
resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack
that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also
within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The
25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the
creature takes 10 damage.
Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that
affect the same damage type count as only one instance.
For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage
as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the
creature, not reduced by three-quarters.
cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once
for all creatures caught in the blast.
Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice
for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the
attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then
add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play,
you can roll all the damage dice at once.
For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger,
roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add
your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other
damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.
Damage Types
Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful
effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have
no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.
The damage types follow, with examples to help a
DM assign a damage type to a new effect.
Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath
and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding
deal acid damage.
Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling,
constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.
Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s
spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath
deal cold damage.
Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.
Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a
damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are
spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.
Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s
breath deal lightning damage.
Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead
and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.
Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including
spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.
Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green
dragon’s breath deal poison damage.
Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic
blast deal psychic damage.
Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame
strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh
like fire and overloads the spirit with power.
Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal
slashing damage.
Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.
Describing the Effects of Damage
Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways.
When your current hit point total is half or more of your
hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury.
When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you
show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack
that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving
a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you
unconscious.

Falling Unconscious
If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you,
you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.
Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must
make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw,
to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang
onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to
any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided
only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.
Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed.
Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect
by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see
below). On your third failure, you die. The successes
and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track
of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of
both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.
Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while
you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw
failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two
failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit
point maximum, you suffer instant death.
Stabilizing a Creature
The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to
heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at
least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death
saving throw.
You can use your action to administer first aid to an
unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which
requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws,
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must
start making death saving throws again, if it takes any
damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains
1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
Monsters and Death
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to
0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and
make death saving throws.
Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are
common exceptions; the DM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.
Knocking a Creature Out
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather
than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a
creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker
can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this
choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
unconscious and is stable.
Healing
Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even
death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can
restore a creature’s hit points (as explained in chapter 8),
and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a
potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.
When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points
regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s
hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit
points regained in excess of this number are lost. For
example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing.
If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the
druid, not 8.
A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until
magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.
Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or
fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.
Instant Death
Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage
remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals
or exceeds your hit point maximum.
For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points
currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from
an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage
remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit
point maximum, the cleric dies.

Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit
points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual
hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit
points that protect you from injury.
When you have temporary hit points and take damage,
the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For
example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take
7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then
take 2 damage.
Because temporary hit points are separate from your
actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and
receive temporary hit points.
Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they
can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points
and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep
the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example,
if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you
already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points
doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.
They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re
in that state, but only true healing can save you.
Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points
has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.
Mounted Combat
A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard
casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of
speed and mobility that a mount can provide.
A willing creature that is at least one size larger than
you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a
mount, using the following rules.
Mounting and Dismounting
Once during your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet
of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t
mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or
if your speed is 0.
If an effect moves your mount against its will while
you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space
within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted,
you must make the same saving throw.
If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your
reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet.
Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a
space within 5 feet it.
Controlling a Mount
While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can
either control the mount or allow it to act independently.
Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.
You can control a mount only if it has been trained to
accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The
initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours
when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has
only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A
controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that
you mount it.
An independent mount retains its place in the initiative
order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions
the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It
might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly
injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.
 In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity
attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or
the mount.
Underwater Combat
When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or
find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must
fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.
When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that
doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted
by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the
weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target
beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target
within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is
thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).
Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water
have resistance to fire damage.

The Rules of Magic
RICHARD WHITTERS

 Chapter 10: Spellcasting
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Spell Slots
Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells
before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and
channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are
even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description
includes a table showing how many spell slots of each
spell level a character can use at each character level. For
example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level
spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.
When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a
slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot
with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of
a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell
of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size,
but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when
Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends
one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.
Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots
(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).
Some characters and monsters have special abilities
that let them cast spells without using spell slots.
Casting a Spell at a Higher Level
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a
higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher
level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic
missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the
slot it is put into.
Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds,
have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as
detailed in a spell’s description.
Cantrips
A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using
a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind
and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce
the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0.
Rituals
Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell
can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting,
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a
spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.
It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual
version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.
To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells
known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.
Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often
appears in the form of a spell.
This chapter provides the rules for casting spells.
Different character classes have distinctive ways of
learning and preparing their spells, and monsters
use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source,
a spell follows the rules here.
What Is a Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of
the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a
specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic
suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular
pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases,
all in the span of seconds.
Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective
wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away,
and restore life to the dead.
Uncounted thousands of spells have been created
over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of
them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in
crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power
and wisdom to do so.
Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but
still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredible time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells
that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The
higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must
be to use that spell.
Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level,
not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.
Known and Prepared Spells
Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have
the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the
spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a
limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in
mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards,
undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.
In every case, the number of spells a caster can have
fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.

 Chapter 10: Spellcasting
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Components
A spell’s components are the physical requirements you
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S),
or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one
or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast
the spell.
Verbal (V)
Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The
words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power;
rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in
motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area
of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t
cast a spell with a verbal component.
Somatic (S)
Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a
somatic component, the caster must have free use of at
least one hand to perform these gestures.
Material (M)
Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified
in parentheses in the component entry. A character can
use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found
in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a
spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she
can cast the spell.
If a spell states that a material component is consumed
by the spell, the caster must provide this component for
each casting of the spell.
A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these
components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can
be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic
components.
Duration
A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists.
A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours,
or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.
Instantaneous
Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals,
creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that
can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for
an instant.
Concentration
Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration,
such a spell ends.
If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that
fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies
how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).
Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules
are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the
spell’s effects.
Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block
of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of
magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The
rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.
Casting Time
Most spells require a single action to cast, but some
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more
time to cast.
Bonus Action
A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell,
provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action
this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.
Reactions
Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take
a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction,
the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.
Longer Casting Times
Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require
more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast
a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or
reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting
the spell, and you must maintain your concentration
while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend
a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you
must start over.
Range
The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For
a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a
spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where
the ball of fire erupts.
Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells
can target only a creature (including you) that you touch.
Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you.
These spells have a range of self.
Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate
from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of
Effect” later in the this chapter).
Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range,
unless the spell’s description says otherwise.
Casting in Armor
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required
for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you
are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted
and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.

location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total
cover, as explained in chapter 9.
Cone
A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of
origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is
equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A
cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.
A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Cube
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere
on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed
as the length of each side.
A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t
interfere with concentration. The following factors can
break concentration:
• Casting another spell that requires concentration.
You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another
spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate
on two spells at once.
• Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while
you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,
whichever number is higher. If you take damage from
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each
source of damage.
• Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration
on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.
The DM might also decide that certain environmental
phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while
you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.
Targets
A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets
to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a
point of origin for an area of effect (described below).
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might
not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like
crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect,
such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically
goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.
A Clear Path to the Target
To target something, you must have a clear path to it,
so it can’t be behind total cover.
If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t
see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you
and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the
near side of that obstruction.
Targeting Yourself
If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can
choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or
specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the
area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.
Areas of Effect
Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an
area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.
A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which
typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of
origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts.
The rules for each shape specify how you position its
point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a
creature or an object.
A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point
of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that
The Schools of Magic
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories
called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards,
apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic
functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives
from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no
rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers,
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish
creatures to other planes of existence.
Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.
Divination spells reveal information, whether in the
form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the
locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or
visions of distant people or places.
Enchantment spells affect the minds of others,
influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can
make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to
take a course of action, or even control another creature
like a puppet.
Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce
a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning.
Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.
Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.
Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force,
drain the life energy from another creature, create the
undead, or even bring the dead back to life.
Creating the undead through the use of necromancy
spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil
casters use such spells frequently.
Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature,
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into
a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make
an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance
a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover
from injury.

D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Cylinder
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a
particular radius, as given in the spell description. The
circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the
spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight
lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect
then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a
distance equal to the height of the cylinder.
A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s
area of effect.
Line
A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path
up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.
A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area
of effect, unless you decide otherwise.
Sphere
You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere
extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.
A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s
area of effect.
Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell
specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and
what happens on a success or failure.
The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus +
any special modifiers.
Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll
to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended
target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.
Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged
attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a
ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile
creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see
chapter 9).
Combining Magical Effects
The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same
spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead,
the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from
those castings applies while their durations overlap. Or
the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally
potent and their durations overlap.
For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he
or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.
The Weave of Magic
The worlds within the D&D multiverse are magical
places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and
potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and
living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the
stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence,
permeating every bit of matter and present in every
manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.
Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between
the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and
recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.
By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away
and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light
a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been
torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape
lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the
blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.
All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds
of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards,
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane
magic. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or
intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks
directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane
magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers
are called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the
Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces
of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath.
Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of
the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect
possible. When characters use divination spells such as
detect magic or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such
as dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic
field rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around,
rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in
places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in
unpredictable ways—or not at all.

Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in it.
Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic
items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a
+1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical
longsword.
A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to
work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination
or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal
to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well
as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that
created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while
in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of
existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer
within the sphere.
Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel
magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres
created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify
each other.
Arcane Eye
4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create an invisible, magical eye within range that
hovers in the air for the duration.
You mentally receive visual information from the eye,
which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.
The eye can look in every direction.
As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of
existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but
the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch
in diameter.
Arcane Lock
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and
the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can
open the object normally. You can also set a password
that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses
this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable
Spell Descriptions
The spells are presented in alphabetical order.
Acid Splash
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one or two creatures
you can see within range. If you choose two, they must
be within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.
This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
Aid
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)
Duration: 8 hours
Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each
target’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.
Antimagic Field
8th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or
iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t
be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic
items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed,
it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as magic missile and charm person, that target
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on
that target.
Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the
sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area
that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example,
the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within
the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is
large enough.

Augury
2nd-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or
similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
Duration: Instantaneous
By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying
out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool,
you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about
the results of a specific course of action that you plan to
take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from
the following possible omens:
Weal, for good results
Woe, for bad results
Weal and woe, for both good and bad results
Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as
the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a
companion.
If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.
Beacon of Hope
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
This spell bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number
of creatures within range. For the duration, each target
has advantage on Wisdom saving throws and death
saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit
points possible from any healing.
Blade Barrier
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades
made of magical energy. The wall appears within range
and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall
up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a
ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5
feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.
When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage.
until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed.
Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for
10 minutes.
While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult
to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any
locks on it increases by 10.
Astral Projection
9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with
this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least
1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at
least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)
Duration: Special
You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell
fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that
plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t
need food or air and doesn’t age.
Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost
every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery
cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and
trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This
cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the
tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the
cord is cut—something that can happen only when an
effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body
are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane
you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your
astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other
effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body,
nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your companions when
you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body, and
it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one of your
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against
an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature.
If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to
0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell
ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the
creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of
suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their
own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0
hit points.

Bless
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You bless up to three creatures of your choice within
range. Whenever a target makes an attack roll or a saving
throw before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and
add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
Blur
2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to
all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has
disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker is
immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely on sight, as with
blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with truesight.
Burning Hands
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cone)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers
spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that
aren’t being worn or carried.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
Chain Lightning
6th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass,
or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)
Duration: Instantaneous
You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of
your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts
then leap from that target to as many as three other
targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first
target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be
targeted by only one of the bolts.
A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps
from the first target to another target for each slot level
above 6th.
Charm Person
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within
range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so
with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.
If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the
spell ends or until you or your companions do anything
harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a
friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature
knows it was charmed by you.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you
target them.
Command
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can
see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or follow the command on its next turn.
The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t
understand your language, or if your command is directly
harmful to it.
Some typical commands and their effects follow. You
might issue a command other than one described here. If
you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If
the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.
Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves
within 5 feet of you.
Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then
ends its turn.
Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you
by the fastest available means.
Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A
flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so.
If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance
needed to remain in the air.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you
target them.
90
 Chapter 11: Spells
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level
or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a
spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using
your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s
level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has
no effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has
no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the
spell slot you used.
Cure Wounds
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal
to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has
no effect on undead or constructs.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
Dancing Lights
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood,
or a glowworm)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create up to four torch-sized lights within range,
making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing
orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also
combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose,
each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights
up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be
within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a
light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s range.
Darkness
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or
piece of coal)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose
within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature
with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.
If the point you choose is on an object you are holding
or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness
emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely
Commune
5th-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or
unholy water)
Duration: 1 minute
You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to
three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.
You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You
receive a correct answer for each question.
Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you
might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question
pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s
knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be
misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM
might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.
If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.
Comprehend Languages
1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
Duration: 1 hour
For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of
any spoken language that you hear. You also understand
any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes
about 1 minute to read one page of text.
This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or
a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.
Cone of Cold
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (60-foot cone)
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
Duration: Instantaneous
A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature
in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw.
A creature takes 8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue
until it thaws.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
Counterspell
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a
creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell
Range: 60 feet
91
 Chapter 11: Spells
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within
30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use
your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature
or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its
school of magic, if any.
The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked
by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of
lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Dimension Door
4th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You teleport yourself from your current location to any
other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize,
or one you can describe by stating distance and direction,
such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the
northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.”
You can bring along objects as long as their weight
doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring
one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be
within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an
object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with
you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to
teleport you.
Disguise Self
1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different
until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss
it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear
thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type,
so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion
is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to
add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and
anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel
your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner
than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to
touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly
still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC.
covering the source of the darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.
If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light
created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
Death Ward
4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours
You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection
from death.
The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a
result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit
point, and the spell ends.
If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected
to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without
dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the
target, and the spell ends.
Delayed Blast Fireball
7th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger,
then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range
as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends,
either because your concentration is broken or because
you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar
into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your
turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.
If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has
expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful
save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When
it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and
the bead explodes.
The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
Detect Magic
1st-level divination (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self

 Chapter 11: Spells
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.

Dominate Monster
8th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within
range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that
are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the
saving throw.
While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic
link with it as long as the two of you are on the same
plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to
issue commands to the creature while you are conscious
(no action required), which it does its best to obey. You
can specify a simple and general course of action, such
as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that
object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t
receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the
creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t
do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time,
you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this
requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving
throw succeeds, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a
9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up
to 8 hours.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see

or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures
that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on
the saving throw.
While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link

Disintegrate
6th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a
target that you can see within range. The target can be a
creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as
the wall created by wall of force.
A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40
force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage
leaves it with 0 hit points.
A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of
fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by
means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or
smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force.
If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force,
this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A
magic item is unaffected by this spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by
3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
Dispel Magic
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action

Duration: Instantaneous
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within
range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.
For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make
an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC
equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the
spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the
effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to
or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning
a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days.
The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short
phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as
the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a
companion.

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and
a lump of clay)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground
that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius
circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and
structures in contact with the ground in that area.
The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each
creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s
concentration is broken.
When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on the
terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A
creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature
that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge
as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit
points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s
height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is
knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a
DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape.
The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on
the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or
become buried.
Etherealness
7th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Up to 8 hours
You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in
the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You
remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until
you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time,
you can move in any direction. If you move up or down,
every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see
and hear the plane you originated from, but everything
there looks gray, and you can’t see anything more than
60 feet away.
While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be
affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that
aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t
You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the
creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t
do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time
you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this
requires you to use your own reaction as well.
Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving
throw succeeds, the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10
minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration
is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot
of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up
to 8 hours.
Dream
5th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Special
Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink,
and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
Duration: 8 hours
This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature
known to you as the target of this spell. The target must
be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that
don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell.
You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state,
acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take
actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the
target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long
as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell.
The messenger can also shape the environment of the
dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images.
The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time,
ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the
dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when
you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either
end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall
asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.
You can make the messenger appear monstrous and
terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the
target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a
nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and
prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that
rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6
psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target
makes its saving throw with disadvantage.

a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature
in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must

interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has
given them the ability to do so.
You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the
Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you
perceive on the plane you originated from.
When the spell ends, you immediately return to the
plane you originated from in the spot you currently
occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object
or creature when this happens, you are immediately
shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of
feet you are moved.
This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on
the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such
as one of the Outer Planes.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three
willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above
7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when
you cast the spell.
Find the Path

Casting Time: 1 minute

as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes—
worth 100 gp and an object from the location you
wish to find)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day
This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct
physical route to a specific fixed location that you are
familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name
a destination on another plane of existence, a destination
that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination
that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the
spell fails.
For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane
of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and
in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there,
whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along
the way, you automatically determine which path is the
shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the
safest route) to the destination.

and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object
has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected
creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or
restrained.

manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can
see within range to a precise location on a different plane
of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you
can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the
portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for
the duration.
The portal has a front and a back on each plane where
it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by
moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the
unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals
created by this spell from opening in their presence or
anywhere within their domains.
When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a
specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t
work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one
you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet
wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being
worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

or broken while the spell remains in effect.
The special component for this version of the spell is
a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken.
The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in
any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will
cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose,
but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable
and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions
can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but
otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or
hit points.
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as
a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special
component used to create it.
You can use a particular special component to create
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using
the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

an owl feather)
Duration: Instantaneous
You choose one object that you must touch throughout
the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other
magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to
use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how
many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells
are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was
created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting,
you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
Imprisonment
9th-level abjuration

statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special
component that varies according to the version of the
spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die
of the target)

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you
can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds,
it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe,
eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t
locate or perceive the target.
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of imprisonment.
Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in
a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor
can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into
or out of it.
The special component for this version of the spell is a
small mithral orb.
Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground,
hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the

until then.
The special component for this version of the spell is a
fine chain of precious metal.
Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a
tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and
planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage,
a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of
your choice.
The special component for this version of the spell is a
miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height
of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar
object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally

4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You
sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as
that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is
moving, you know the direction of its movement.
The spell can locate a specific creature known to
you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as
a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a
creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the
creature you described or named is in a different form,
such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this
spell doesn’t locate the creature.
This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at
least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and
the creature.
Mage Armor
1st-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)

padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or
magical means that prevents access.
A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that
is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them
is unlocked.
If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock,

time the target can be opened and shut normally.
When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as
far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.
Lesser Restoration

Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a
piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long
shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
One creature or loose object of your choice that you
can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and
remains suspended there for the duration. The spell
can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An
unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving
throw is unaffected.
The target can move only by pushing or pulling against
a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or
a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.
You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in
either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you
can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise,
you can use your action to move the target, which must
remain within the spell’s range.

20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely
covering the object with something opaque blocks the
light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as
an action.

spot within range. As the image changes location, you
can alter its appearance so that its movements appear
natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so
that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the
illusion to make different sounds at different times, even
making it carry on a conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.
Mass Cure Wounds

within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until
you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is

You can use your action to control the hand. You can
use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked
door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open
container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can

more dart for each slot level above 1st.
Magic Weapon

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends,
that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to
attack rolls and damage rolls.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2.
When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus
increases to +3.
Major Image
3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-
foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see
within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature
appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough
to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell
that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can
use your action to cause the image to move to any other

Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a
40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose
must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads
around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and
20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area
of more than one fiery burst is affected only once.
The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.
Minor Illusion
Illusion cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: 1 minute
You create a sound or an image of an object within range
that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you
dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.
If you create a sound, its volume can range from a
whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s
voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound
you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout
the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different
times before the spell ends.
If you create an image of an object—such as a chair,
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light,
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things
can pass through it.
If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with
a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.
Misty Step
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.
Mordenkainen’s Sword
7th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a
grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers
within range. It lasts for the duration.
When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the
sword. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by
1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.
Mass Suggestion
6th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
Duration: 24 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures
of your choice that you can see within range and that
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
other obviously harmful act automatically negates the
effect of the spell.
Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might
suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the
first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before
the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed.
If you or any of your companions damage a creature
affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7thlevel spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an
8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use
a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.
Maze
8th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You banish a creature that you can see within range into
a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for
the duration or until it escapes the maze.
The target can use its action to attempt to escape.
When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If
it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or
goristro demon automatically succeeds).
When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space
it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind
of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful
save, this stunning effect ends.
Prayer of Healing
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 30 feet

spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
Prestidigitation
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Up to 1 hour
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice
spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the
following magical effects within range:
• You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect,
such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical
notes, or an odd odor.
• You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch,
or a small campfire.
• You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger
than 1 cubic foot.
• You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving
material for 1 hour.
• You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on
an object or a surface for 1 hour.
• You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image
that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of

you can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
Otto’s Irresistible Dance
6th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose one creature that you can see within range. The
target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping
its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that
can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.
A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance
without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is
affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on
attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature
makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself.
On a successful save, the spell ends.
Passwall
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
Duration: 1 hour
A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can
see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall,
a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet
wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no
instability in a structure surrounding it.
When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects
still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected
to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which
you cast the spell.
Poison Spray
Conjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S

 Chapter 11: Spells
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing
ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the
duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the
start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).
The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails,
and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you
have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell
instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.
Remove Curse
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object
end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the
object so it can be removed or discarded.
Resistance
Abjuration cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell
ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled
to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before
or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.
Resurrection
7th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more
than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t
undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to
life with all its hit points.
This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal
diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t,
however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if
such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they
afflict the target on its return to life.
This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any
missing body parts.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest,
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has
been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until
you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you
have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to
three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and
you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
Protection from Energy
3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder.
Raise Dead
5th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp,
which the spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that
it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s
soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the
creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the
creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead
creature to life.
This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body
parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest,
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

holy text written on it)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of
your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for
the duration.
Shocking Grasp
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to
a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack
against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll
if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the
target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
Silence
2nd-level illusion (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass
through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you
choose within range. Any creature or object entirely
inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and
creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting
a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
Silent Image
1st-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Revivify
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the
spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute.
That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell
can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor
can it restore any missing body parts.
Sacred Flame
Evocation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can
see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target
gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.
The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
Sanctuary
1st-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
Duration: 1 minute
You ward a creature within range against attack. Until
the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must
choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell
doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects,
such as the explosion of a fireball.
If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell
that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
Shatter
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a chip of mica)
Duration: Instantaneous
A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts
from a point of your choice within range. Each creature
in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must
make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8
thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on
this saving throw.
A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried
also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

Components: V, S, M (burning incense)
Duration: 10 minutes
You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a
corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer
the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a
mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse
was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief,
cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it
recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the
creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus,
the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t
speculate about future events.
Spider Climb
2nd-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains
the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces
and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands
free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its
walking speed.
Spirit Guardians
3rd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot radius)
Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you
to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or
neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your
choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.
When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An
affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when
the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant
damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
Spiritual Weapon
2nd-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or some
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts
for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
You can use your action to cause the image to move to
any spot within range. As the image changes location,
you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an
image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image
so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image.
Sleep
1st-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 90 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals,
or a cricket)
Duration: 1 minute
This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll
5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this
spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you
choose within range are affected in ascending order of
their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current
hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage,
or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper
awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total
before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit
points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less
than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t
affected by this spell.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for
each slot level above 1st.
Spare the Dying
Necromancy cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The
creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

Sunburst
8th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 150 feet
Components: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
Duration: Instantaneous
Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a
point you choose within range. Each creature in that light
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded
for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much
damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes
have disadvantage on this saving throw.
A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a
successful save, it is no longer blinded.
This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
Teleport
7th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing
creatures of your choice that you can see within range,
or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able
to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or
carried by an unwilling creature.
The destination you choose must be known to you, and
it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your
familiarity with the destination determines whether you
arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults
the table.
Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent
teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you possess an object taken
from the desired destination within the last six months,
such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a
royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.
“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see
when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace
you have seen more than once but with which you aren’t
very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen
once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place
whose location and appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead
viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a
familiar location that no longer exists.
On Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear where you want to.
Off Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear a random distance away from the destination in
a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10
percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target,
and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that
lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.
When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell
attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On
a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your
spellcasting ability modifier.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.
The weapon can take whatever form you choose.
Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular
weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and
Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble
that weapon.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.
Stoneskin
4th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which
the spell consumes)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch
as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has
resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.
Suggestion
2nd-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)
Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours
You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) and magically influence a creature you can see
within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.
The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to
make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the
creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends
the spell.
The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might
suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar
she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.
If you or any of your companions damage the target, the
spell ends.

Thunderwave
1st-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (15-foot cube)
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each
creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet
away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes
half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely
within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet
away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a
thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
Time Stop
9th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself.
No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 +
1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and
move as normal.
This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this
period, or any effects that you create during this period,
affects a creature other than you or an object being worn
or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the
spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet
from the location where you cast it.
True Resurrection
9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and
diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the
spell consumes)
Duration: Instantaneous
You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer
than 200 years and that died for any reason except old
age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature
is restored to life with all its hit points.
This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison,
cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing
organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
The spell can even provide a new body if the original
no longer exists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied
space you choose within 10 feet of you.
off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines
the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on
around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting
to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you
could be in trouble.
Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object)
wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically
similar to the target area. If you are heading for your
home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop
that has many of the same tools and implements as your
laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar
place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could
conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target
object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on
the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can
occur, dealing damage each time).

Thaumaturgy
Transmutation cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V
Duration: Up to 1 minute
You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural
power, within range. You create one of the following
magical effects within range:
• Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal
for 1 minute.
• You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change
color for 1 minute.
• You cause harmless tremors in the ground
for 1 minute.
• You create an instantaneous sound that originates from
a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of
thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers.
• You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window
to fly open or slam shut.
• You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to
three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can
dismiss such an effect as an action.

It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported
by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you
must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You
can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30
hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit
points destroys it and might cause connected panels to
collapse at the DM’s discretion.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its
whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t
be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the
spell ends.
Warding Bond
2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at
least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear
for the duration)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates
a mystic connection between you and the target until the
spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it
gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage,
you take the same amount of damage.
The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and
the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also
ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected
creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.
Web
2nd-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of
your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube
from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult
terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses
(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or
ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell
ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a
flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long
as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it
succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire
damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
True Seeing
6th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs
25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and
fat; and is consumed by the spell)
Duration: 1 hour
This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability
to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the
creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by
magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out to a
range of 120 feet.
Wall of Fire
4th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range.
You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high,
and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and
lasts for the duration.
When the wall appears, each creature within its area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage
on a successful save.
One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this
spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its
turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for
the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other
side of the wall deals no damage.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by
1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
Wall of Stone
5th-level evocation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence
at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches
thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other
panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your
choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by
the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it
can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no
longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t
occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall
doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation.

Part 4
Dungeon Master’s Tools
RICHARD WHITTERS
110 Chapter 12: Monsters
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
As the Dungeon Master, you have a vast array of
resources available to you to make the game exciting
and fun for the players—and monsters are at the top of
the list. A monster is defined as any creature that can be
interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even
something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a
unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also
applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk who
might be friends or rivals to the player characters.
This chapter presents a wide selection of ready-toplay monsters—a sample of what can be found in the
Monster Manual. Each description uses a standardized
format that clearly explains the monster’s capabilities.
Guidelines for understanding the information found in a
monster’s statistics are given below.
Statistics
A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its stat
block, provide the essential information that you need to
run the monster.
Size
A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or
Gargantuan. See chapter 9 of this document for more information on creature size and space.
Type
A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects
in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a
particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying
deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other
creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles
and wyverns.
The game includes the following monster types, which
have no rules of their own.
Aberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them
have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s
alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world.
The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders,
mind flayers, and slaadi.
Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural
part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical
powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society
or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals.
Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes.
Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as
messengers or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the
exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment
is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls,
and pegasi.
Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed
by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions,
while others are imbued with sentience and capable of
independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs.
Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus,
such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the
raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful
creatures.
Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin
and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good
metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are
highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but
less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as
wyverns and pseudodragons.
Elementals are creatures native to the elemental
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than
animate masses of their respective elements, including
the creatures simply called elementals. Others have
biological forms infused with elemental energy. The
races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most
important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other
elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and
water weirds.
Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of
nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests.
In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also
called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the
Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the
Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.
Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities,
but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils
and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes
summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding.
If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds,
rakshasas, and yugoloths.
Giants tower over humans and their kind. They are
humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads
(ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of
true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire
giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these,
creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.
Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&D world,
both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language
and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though
most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal
form. The most common humanoid races are the ones
most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves,
elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more
savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the
races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears),
orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.
Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense—
frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly
natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of
magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears),
and others are the product of terrible curses (including
minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in
some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures
that don’t fit into any other type.

Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed
shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves
and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings
and gelatinous cubes are among the most recognizable oozes.
Plants in this context are vegetable creatures, not ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are
carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling
mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas
spore and the myconid also fall into this category.
Undead are once-living creatures brought to a horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic
magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking
corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.
Tags
A monster might have one or more tags appended to its
type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the humanoid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional
categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no
rules of their own, but something in the game, such as
a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear
that is especially effective at fighting demons would work
against any monster that has the demon tag.
Alignment
A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition
and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation.
For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult
to reason with and might attack characters on sight,
whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate.
See chapter 4 of this document for descriptions of the
different alignments.
The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is
the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you
want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant,
there’s nothing stopping you.
Some creatures can have any alignment. In other
words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion
toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker
can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.
Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make
moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These
creatures are unaligned, which means they don’t have an
alignment.
Armor Class
A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity
into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its
Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster
has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this
is noted in parentheses after its AC value.
Hit Points
A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops
to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see chapter 1 of
this document.
A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die
expression and as an average number. For example, a
monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).
A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate
its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.
Hit Dice by Size
Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die
Tiny d4 2½
Small d6 3½
Medium d8 4½
Large d10 5½
Huge d12 6½
Gargantuan d20 10½
A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the
number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is
multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and
the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).
Speed
A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its
turn. For more information on speed, see chapter 8 and
chapter 9 of this document.
All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the
monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of groundbased locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.
Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement modes.
Burrow
A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed
to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t
burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait
that allows it to do so.
Climb
A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of
its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster
doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb.
Fly
A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of
its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to
hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as
explained in the rules on flying in chapter 9 of this document). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.
Swim
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to
spend extra movement to swim.

Ability Scores
Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity,
Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and
corresponding modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used in play, see chapter 7 of
this document.
Saving Throws
The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that
are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened
might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most
creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in
which case this section is absent.
A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the
Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).
Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating

Skills
The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is
very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined
by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers
might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larger-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency
bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.
Vulnerabilities, Resistances,
and Immunities
Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are
even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a
magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some
creatures are immune to certain conditions.
Senses
The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom
(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are described below.
Blindsight
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings
without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray
oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures
with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and
true dragons.
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical
note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.
Darkvision
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a
specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within
the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as
if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in
darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live
underground have this special sense.
Tremorsense
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the
origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided
that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in
contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense
can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures.
Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber
hulks, have this special sense.
Truesight
A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see
in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures
and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and
succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive
the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see
into the Ethereal Plane within the same range.
Languages
The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a
language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry.
A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor understands any language.
Telepathy
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to
communicate mentally with another creature within a
specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to
share a language with the monster to communicate in
this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least
one language. A creature without telepathy can receive
and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or
terminate a telepathic conversation.
A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted
creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time.
113
 Chapter 12: Monsters
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are
no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic
monster contacts a different creature within range. A
telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic
conversation without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact,
and any current contact is terminated.
A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in
any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t
send or receive telepathic messages.
Challenge
A monster’s challenge rating tells you how great a threat
the monster is, according to the encounter-building
guidelines in chapter 13 of this document. Those guidelines specify the number of adventurers of a certain level
that should be able to defeat a monster of a particular
challenge rating without suffering any deaths.
Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level
characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except
in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are
worth no experience points, while those that have attacks
are worth 10 XP each.
Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a
typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have
a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test player skill.
Experience Points
The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth
is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded
for defeating the monster, although the DM may also
award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the monster in some other manner.
Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP
noted in its stat block.
The guidelines in chapter 13 of this document explain
how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as
how to adjust an encounter’s difficulty.
Experience Points by Challenge Rating
Challenge XP Challenge XP
0 0 or 10 14 11,500
1/8 25 15 13,000

Special Traits
Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge
rating but before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter
and that require some explanation.
Innate Spellcasting
A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the
Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise,
an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its
lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level.
If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no
level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating.
An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions.
For example, a drow mage can innately cast the levitate
spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which
means that the spell affects only the drow mage.
A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with
other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them.
Spellcasting
A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spellcaster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells
of 1st level and higher (as explained in chapter 10 of this
document). The spellcaster level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.
The monster has a list of spells known or prepared
from a particular class. The list might also include spells
from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain
feature of the cleric. The monster is considered a member of that class when attuning to or using a magic item
that requires membership in the class or access to its
spell list.
A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level
if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage
with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5thlevel spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots.
You can change the spells that a monster knows or has
prepared, replacing any spell on a monster’s spell list
with a different spell of the same level and from the same
class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to
be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.
Actions
When a monster takes its action, it can choose from
the options in the Actions section of its stat block or
use one of the actions available to all creatures, such
as the Dash or Hide action, as described in chapter 9 of
this document.
Melee and Ranged Attacks
The most common actions that a monster will take in
combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell
attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be
a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw
or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of
attacks, see chapter 9 of this document.
Creature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged
attack is usually either one creature or one target, the
difference being that a “target” can be a creature or
an object.
114
 Chapter 12: Monsters
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as
a result of an attack hitting a target are described after
the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average
damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the
average damage and the die expression are presented.
Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss,
that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation.
Multiattack
A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has
the Multiattack ability. A creature can’t use Multiattack
when making an opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.
Ammunition
A monster carries enough ammunition to make its
ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4
pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and
2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such
as a bow or crossbow.
Reactions
If a monster can do something special with its reaction,
that information is contained here. If a creature has no
special reaction, this section is absent.
Limited Usage
Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of
times they can be used.
X/Day. The notation “X/Day” means a special ability
can be used X number of times and that a monster must
finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example,
“1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that
the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.
Recharge X–Y. The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a
monster can use a special ability once and that the ability
then has a random chance of recharging during each
subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the
monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers
in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of
the special ability. The ability also recharges when the
monster finishes a short or long rest.
For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can
use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or
6 on a d6.
Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation
means that a monster can use a special ability once and
then must finish a short or long rest to use it again.
Equipment
A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor
or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be
dressed appropriately.
You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you like, using chapter 5 of this document
for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster’s
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and
whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered
suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by
someone else, for instance.
If a spellcasting monster needs material components
to cast its spells, assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells in its stat block.
Legendary Creatures
A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can take special actions outside its turn,
and it might exert magical influence for miles around.
If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature,
such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or regional effects.
Legendary Actions
A legendary creature can take a certain number of
special actions—called legendary actions—outside its
turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at
a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A
creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start
of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them
while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions.
If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in
the combat.
A Legendary Creature’s Lair
A legendary creature might have a section describing
its lair and the special effects it can create while there,
either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all
legendary creatures have lairs. This section applies only
to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in
their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there.
Lair Actions
If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them
to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative
count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair
action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one
until after its first turn in the combat.
Regional Effects
The mere presence of a legendary creature can have
strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as
noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over time when the legendary creature dies.
Grapple Rules for Monsters
Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to
quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an
attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to
determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack
says otherwise.
A creature grappled by the monster can use its action
to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the
escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC
is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength
(Athletics) modifier.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Actions
Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence.
It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two
with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
Frightful Presence. Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for
the next 24 hours.
Fire Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales fire in a
60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21
Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (18d6) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Legendary Actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed
on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon
can then fly up to half its flying speed.
The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon,
whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its
eyes dance with flame when it is angry.
A Red Dragon’s Lair
Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in
caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep
halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds.
Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most
highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases
wash over a dragon as it sleeps.
With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red
dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain
as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world
are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it
controls—and the wider world it seeks to control.
Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of
its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has
conquered.
Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects;
the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:
• Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon
can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high,
5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking
21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
• A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the
dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the
ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw or be knocked prone.
• Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere
centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet
of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area
is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on
the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the
cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While
poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.
Regional Effects
The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is
warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more
of the following effects:
• Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the
dragon’s lair.
• Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.
• Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form
portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.
If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of
1d10 days.

knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a
wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another
creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the
bludgeoning damage and isn’t flung away or knocked prone.

Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet
of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the
basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw if the basilisk isn’t incapacitated. On a failed
save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is
restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its
next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the
creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell
or other magic.
A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the
saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see
the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its
eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.
If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in
bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself
with its gaze.

polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or
back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the
same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Ambusher. In the first round of a combat, the doppelganger
has advantage on attack rolls against any creature
it surprised.
Surprise Attack. If the doppelganger surprises a creature and
hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the
target takes an extra 10 (3d6) damage from the attack.
Actions
Multiattack. The doppelganger makes two melee attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
Read Thoughts. The doppelganger magically reads the
surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The
effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt,
2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead
blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can
continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger’s
concentration isn’t broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
While reading the target’s mind, the doppelganger has
advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception,
Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.
Doppelgangers are devious shapeshifters that take on
the appearance of other humanoids, throwing off pursuit or luring victims to their doom with misdirection
and disguise.

Berserk. Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points
or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each
of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest
creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to
and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for
an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk,
it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all
its hit points.
The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem,
can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The
golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an
action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the
check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes
damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might
go berserk again.
Aversion of Fire. If the golem takes fire damage, it has
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end
of its next turn.

that would alter its form.

against spells and other magical effects.

Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5
(1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
Actions
Withering Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,

Etherealness. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane
while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t
affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
Horrifying Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet
of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by
5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.
If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the
next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater
restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost can
see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma
saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then
disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control
of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t
deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted
by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn
undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It
otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t
gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or
proficiencies.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points,
the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or
forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When
the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this
ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the
saving throw or after the possession ends.
A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to
haunt a location, creature, or object from its life.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.
Club. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
Luring Song. The harpy sings a magical melody. Every
humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear
the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw
or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a
bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It
can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is
incapacitated.
While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and
ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is
more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move
on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying
to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but
before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit,
and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target
can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s
song for the next 24 hours.
A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the torso, arms, and head of a human female.
Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to
their deaths.

Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa’s
eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa
can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if
the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If
the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly
petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to
turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
restoration spell or other magic.
Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it
can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in
the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface
within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa
is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

Eye Rays. The spectator shoots up to two of the following
magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90
feet of it. It can use each ray only once on a turn.
1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the end
of its next turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it
uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a
randomly determined creature within range. If the target can’t
attack, it does nothing on its turn.
2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Create Food and Water. The spectator magically creates
enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours.
Reactions
Spell Reflection. If the spectator makes a successful saving
throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator
can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can
see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature
instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw,
the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an
attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.
A spectator is a lesser type of beholder—a foul and deadly
aberration. It resembles a floating sphere with a gaping
maw and a single great eye, set within four eyestalks that
shoot forth deadly rays.

target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss.
The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its
movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood
from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the
target, can use its action to detach the stirge.
This horrid monster looks like a cross between a large

On a failed save, a target can’t use reactions, its speed is
halved, and it can’t make more than one attack on its turn.
In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus
action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute.
A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Amphibious. The dragon can breathe air and water.
Actions
Multiattack. The dragon makes three attacks: one with its
bite and two with its claws.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6)
poison damage.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Poison Breath (Recharge 5–6). The dragon exhales poisonous
gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make
a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons,
green dragons use misdirection and trickery to get the
upper hand against their enemies. A green dragon is
recognized by the crest that begins near its eyes and
continues down its spine, reaching full height just behind
the skull.

from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit
point instead.
Actions
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
Undead zombies move with a jerky, uneven gait. They are
clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest,
and carry the stench of decay.

This section contains statistics for various humanoid
nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a D&D campaign. These stat blocks can
be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.
Customizing NPCs
There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this
appendix for your home campaign.
Racial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC.
For example, a halfling priest might have a speed of 25
feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC
doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial
traits, see chapter 2 of this document.
Spell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can
substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list.
Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s
challenge rating.
Armor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or
downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons.
Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC’s challenge rating.
Magic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more
likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. A
mage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as
well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC
a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.
A few magic items are described in chapter 14 of
this document.

When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination run wild and build something your players will
enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.
Combat Encounter Difficulty
There are four categories of encounter difficulty.
Easy. An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’
resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a
few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.
Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or two
scary moments for the players, but the characters should
emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of
them might need to use healing resources.
Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the
fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more characters might die.
Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or
more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

Evaluating Encounter Difficulty
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any
combat encounter.
1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the
party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table has
four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each
category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to
determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process
for every character in the party.
2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold. For each
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’
XP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold.
You’ll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.
For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level
characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:
Easy: 275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)
Medium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)
Hard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)
Deadly: 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)
Record the totals, because you can use them for every
encounter in your adventure.
3. Total the Monsters’ XP. Add up the XP for all of
the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP
value in its stat block.
4. Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the
encounter includes more than one monster, apply a
multiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters
there are, the more attack rolls you’re making against the
characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the
encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s
difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in
the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.
For example, if an encounter includes four monsters
worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP.
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in
terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help
you accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty.
When making this calculation, don’t count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the
average challenge rating of the other monsters in the
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.
Encounter Multipliers
Number of
Monsters Multiplier
1 × 1
2 × 1.5
3–6 × 2
Number of
Monsters Multiplier
7–10 × 2.5
11–14 × 3
15 or more × 4
5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP
value to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that
equals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s
difficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold
that is lower than the adjusted XP value.
For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three
hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it
a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters
and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter
threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of
1,400 XP).

D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Party Size
The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party
consisting of three to five adventurers.
If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply
the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers
table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the
characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for
groups of fifteen or more monsters.
If the party contains six or more characters, use the
next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5
for a single monster.
Multipart Encounters
Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that
the party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters
might come at the party in waves. For such encounters,
treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter
for the purpose of determining its difficulty.
A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of
a multipart encounter, so they won’t be able to spend Hit
Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP
value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher
than one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the
adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the
encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.
Building Encounters on a
Budget
You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget
that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium,
hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups
of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base
XP values would indicate (see step 4).
For example, using the party from step 2, you can build
a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted
XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s
threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825
XP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single
monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or
owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you
want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times
its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP
each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a
medium encounter for the party as well.
To assist with this approach, appendix B in the Dungeon Master’s Guide presents a list of all monsters in
the Monster Manual organized by challenge rating. See
“Monsters by Challenge Rating” later in this chapter for a
list by CR of the monsters included in this document.
The Adventuring Day
Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to
eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get
through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can
handle fewer.
In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other
opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the
party is likely to progress.
For each character in the party, use the Adventuring
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all
party members to get a total for the party’s adventuring
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP
value for encounters the party can handle before the
characters will need to take a long rest.

20th 40,000
Short Rests
In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the
party will likely need to take two short rests, about onethird and two-thirds of the way through the day.
Modifying Encounter Difficulty
An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the
choice of location and the situation.
Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step
(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have
a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty
by one step if the characters have a benefit that their enemies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes
the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the
characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two
cancel each other out.
Situational drawbacks include the following:
• The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn’t.
• The enemy has cover, and the party doesn’t.
• The characters are unable to see the enemy.
• The characters are taking damage every round from
some environmental effect or magical source.
• The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of
scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise in a situation that hinders their mobility.
Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except
that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.
Fun Combat Encounters
The following features can add more fun and suspense to
a combat encounter:
• Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope
bridge and pools of green slime
• Terrain features that provide a change of elevation,
such as pits, stacks of empty crates, and ledges

• Features that either inspire or force characters and
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers,
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps
• Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions, so that characters who normally attack at range
are forced to move around the battlefield

Challenge Rating
When putting together an encounter or adventure,
especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using
monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party’s
average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage
with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level.
For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can
kill a 1st-level wizard with a single blow.

 Chapter 14: Magic Items
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Every adventure holds the promise—but not a
guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. This
chapter presents an assortment of magic items that hints
at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in
the worlds of D&D. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for
many more items.
Using a Magic Item
A magic item’s description explains how the item works.
Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a
sense that something is extraordinary about the item.
The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s
properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one
magic item during a short rest, while being in physical
contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character
learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them.
Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the
taster what the potion does.
Some magic items require a creature to form a bond
with them before their magical properties can be used.
This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a
prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature
must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If
the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies
if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features,
not using a magic item or the like.
Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short
rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn
the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of
weapon practice, meditation, or some other appropriate
activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement
attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the
creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any
necessary command words.
An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time,
and a creature can be attuned to no more than three
magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an
item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more
than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t
attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.
A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature
no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if
the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes
to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item,
unless the item is cursed.
Item Descriptions
Amulet of Health
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)
Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet.
It has no effect on you if your Constitution is 19 or higher
without it.
Armor, +1, +2, or +3
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2),
or legendary (+3)
You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The
bonus is determined by its rarity.
Bag of Holding
Wondrous item, uncommon
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than
its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at
the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500
pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag
weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving
an item from the bag requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the
Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the
bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10
divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute),
after which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional
space created by a Heward’s handy haversack, portable
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.
Boots of Striding and Springing
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and
your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times
the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than
your remaining movement would allow.
Cloak of Elvenkind
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and
you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to
hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Gauntlets of Ogre Power
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is 19 or
higher without them.
Gloves of Swimming and Climbing
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming
don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.
Goggles of Night
Wondrous item, uncommon
While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out
to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.
Headband of Intellect
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is 19 or
higher without it.
Keoghtom’s Ointment
Wondrous item, uncommon
This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1
doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The
jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.
As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it
regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is
cured of any disease.
Potion of Flying
Potion, very rare
When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal
to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re
in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you
have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s
clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has
cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
Potion of Invisibility
Potion, very rare
This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it
holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for
1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you.
The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
Potion of Vitality
Potion, very rare
When you drink this potion, it removes any exhaustion
you are suffering and cures any disease or poison affecting you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum
number of hit points for any Hit Die you spend. The
potion’s crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light,
calling to mind a heartbeat.
Ring of Evasion
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction
to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving
throw instead.
Ring of Protection
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring.
Ring of Resistance
Ring, rare (requires attunement)
You have resistance to one damage type while wearing
this ring. The gem in the ring indicates the type, which
the DM chooses or determines randomly.

Spell Scroll
Scroll, varies
A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written
in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll
is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is
cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust.
If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.
If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher
level than you can normally cast, you must make an
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the
spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from
the scroll with no other effect.
Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and
the scroll itself crumbles to dust.
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the
scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

8th Very rare 18 +10
9th Legendary 19 +11
A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as
spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied
from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s
level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll
is destroyed.
Wand of Magic Detection
Wand, uncommon
This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can
expend 1 charge as an action to cast the detect magic
spell from it. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges
daily at dawn.
Wand of Magic Missiles
Wand, uncommon
While you hold this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its 7 charges to cast the magic missile spell
without using any components. For 1 charge, you cast the
spell as if you used a 1st-level spell slot, and you increase
the spell slot level by one for each additional charge
you spend.
The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day
at dawn. However, if you expend the wand’s last charge,
roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is
destroyed.
Weapon, +1, +2, or +3
Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)
You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
this magic weapon. The bonus is determined by the
weapon’s rarity.

as invisible, can be advantageous.
A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone
condition is countered by standing up, for example) or
for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the
condition.
If multiple effects impose the same condition on a
creature, each instance of the condition has its own
duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse.
A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.
The following definitions specify what happens to
a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or
grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled
away by the thunderwave spell.
Incapacitated
• An incapacitated creature can’t take actions
or reactions.

 Appendix B: Gods of the Multiverse
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
Religion is an important part of life in the worlds of
the D&D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics
channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices
in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like
beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent
about the deities and deny their existence.
Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different
gods at different times and circumstances. People in the
Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for
luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading
to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe
storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a
favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings
they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest
or champion of that god’s ideals.
Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped
in his or her campaign. From among the gods available,
you can choose a single deity for your character to serve,
worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that
your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental
note of the gods who are revered in your DM’s campaign
so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you’re
playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and
consider the deity’s suggested domains when selecting
your character’s domain.
D&D Pantheons
Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own pantheons
of deities. This appendix deals with one pantheon, that of
the Forgotten Realms.
The Forgotten Realms
Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared
throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least
thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and
many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes,
small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples.
Nonhuman Deities
Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races
are revered on many different worlds, though not always
in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten
Realms and Greyhawk share these deities.
Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of
their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf
gods include Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and
a number of other gods thought to be their children
and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard,
Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn,
Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard
Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of
dwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities,
and some have other gods unknown (or known by other
names) to outsiders.
Unconscious
• An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the
condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware
of its surroundings.
• The creature drops whatever it’s holding and
falls prone.
• The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
saving throws.
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
• Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the
attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
Appendix B: Gods of
the Multiverse
Exhaustion
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as
specified in the effect’s description.
Level Effect
1 Disadvantage on ability checks
2 Speed halved
3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4 Hit point maximum halved
5 Speed reduced to 0
6 Death
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases
by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
A creature suffers the effect of its current level of
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a
creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved
and has disadvantage on ability checks.
An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion
effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is
reduced below 1.
Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some
food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a
creature’s exhaustion level by 1.

Order of the
Gauntlet
The Order of the Gauntlet is a
relatively new organization dedicated to smiting evil wherever
it lurks and without hesitation.
Its members understands that
evil wears many guises, playing
games and tricking others in
order to hasten its spread. That
is why its members act on their
own authority, identifying threats
and removing them before they
can reach their full potential.
Because the seeds of evil are
nourished in the shadows, the
Order of the Gauntlet rides out to the most dangerous
dungeons, the darkest caverns, and the foulest pits to
weed out wrongdoers. Even so, its members are keenly
aware that the seed of evil lies within everyone, waiting
for a moment when it can take root in their souls. The order’s paladins, monks, and clerics spend long hours deep
in prayer to keep their inner eye vigilant and focused on
their own thoughts and emotions. In this way they purify
themselves from within before taking up their swords to
cleanse the world.
The Order of the Gauntlet believes that all sentient
beings must come forth into the light of reason and goodness of their own volition. That is why the faction is not
interested in controlling minds: it focuses only on deeds,
setting an example for the world in the hope of inspiring
and enlightening others. The order holds that faith in
one’s god, one’s friends, and one’s self are the best weapons for combating the hordes of malice.
Possessed of such devout conviction, the order’s
members can be relied on as a source of strength
to themselves and others, a bright light against the
darkness. They are not preemptive bullies, though. A
strict code of honor allows them to strike only when
evil deeds are being committed. Thus, the Order of the
Gauntlet is constantly vigilant, using every resource at its
disposal—both magical and mundane—to tell where and
when dark deeds will occur.
That’s the thing about evil: it is darkness, it is shadow, it hides
in your blind spot. Then, when you are distracted, it sneaks
in. Evil is a master of disguise—and what is the greatest disguise, you ask? Yourself. Evil will cloak itself in thoughts and
emotions pretending to be your own, telling you to get angry,
to be greedy and envious, to hold yourself above others.
Many characters created in the Forgotten Realms
setting, especially those for organized D&D play, belong
to one of five factions that have risen to prominence in the
world of Faerûn. Each faction has its own motivations,
goals, and philosophy. Some are more heroic than others,
but all band together in times of trouble to address major threats.
Harpers
The clandestine network of
spellcasters and spies known
as the Harpers seeks to tip the
scales in favor of the innocent,
the weak, and the poor. Harper
agents pride themselves on
being incorruptible defenders
of good, and they never hesitate
to aid the oppressed. Because
they prefer to work behind the
scenes, they are rarely noticed
as they thwart tyrants, depose
rulers, and head off any growing
force that is thought to have evil
intent. The faction has its finger
on the pulse of power in the
Realms, and its members work tirelessly to even the odds
for the downtrodden.
Individual Harper agents operate alone, relying on their
wits and the faction’s extensive information network to
gain an advantage over their enemies. They know that
knowledge is power, so gathering intelligence beforehand
is paramount to their success. They are well informed
and always have access to aid, magical and otherwise.
Veteran members have secret caches of information
stashed all over Faerûn, along with trusted sources stationed in every major town and city.
The organization is always on the lookout for powerful items, expressly to keep them out of the hands of
evildoers. To this end, its agents use various guises and
identities to aid their search for carefully guarded secrets
such as ancestral maps, buried cities, and mages’ keeps.
The bond between Harpers is strong, and the
friendships they form are nigh unbreakable. Rarely do
they operate in the open, but on rare occasions they must,
because there is no other choice. When that happens,
you can be sure that a fellow Harper is watching closely,
ready to dart out from the shadows and help a comrade at
a moment’s notice.
A Harper is first and foremost self-reliant, for once you are
autonomous, no one can tempt you into using power as a
crutch. You are sovereign unto yourself.
Therefore, a Harper’s soul must be incorruptible. Many
believe themselves to be so, but power comes in many guises,
and it will surely find your weakness. Of this you may be
certain. Only a true Harper can pass this test and transform
weakness into strength. That is why we are the hand that
Appendix C: The Five Factions

People aren’t born evil—it takes time for evil to fool you
into thinking that its voice is yours. That is why to know who
you truly are is what the order requires from each hopeful
who wishes to join our ranks. Bravery isn’t fighting the dragon out there—it is fighting the dragon within. That is what
we do in our prayers. Once you have slain that dragon, you
have overcome the darkness lurking within yourself. Only
then do you have the capacity to know true goodness. Only
then are you ready to take up the sword and wear the badge
of our order.
—Kajiso Steelhand
Emerald Enclave
The Emerald Enclave is a far-ranging group that opposes
threats to the natural world and helps others survive
in the wilderness. Branches of
the organization are scattered
throughout Faerûn and often
operate in isolation from the
others. This existence instills in
the enclave’s members a fierce
self-reliance and mastery of certain fighting and survival skills.
A ranger of the enclave might
be hired to lead a caravan
through a treacherous mountain pass or across the frozen
tundra of Icewind Dale. A druid
might volunteer to help a village
prepare for a long, brutal winter.
Barbarians and druids who live
as hermits might appear from nowhere to help defend a
town against marauding orcs.
Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive
and, more important, how to help others do the same.
They are not opposed to civilization or progress, but
they strive to keep such “advances” in balance with the
wild. They restore and preserve the natural order, even
as they root out and destroy all that is unnatural. They
keep the elemental forces of the world in check and
prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying
one another.
We of the Emerald Enclave serve as gatekeepers to that vast
space beyond the city walls. We are the defenders both of the
wilderness and of the society that does not understand it.
Most have forgotten that there is an ancient, natural order
that held sway long before we formed our intellectual concepts of it. To come into contact with that primal order is to
touch the power that guides all of life.
Those who walk the way of the Emerald Enclave are
infused with this power; we embody it, and it moves us to
do our work. That is why we are never alone. Even in the
midst of a noisy, crowded city, we can feel the presence of the
natural world inside us, fresh, strong, and alive. The enclave
seeks to make awareness of this power available to all.
Freedom. Is not this the highest of callings?
—Delaan Winterhound
Lords’ Alliance
The Lords’ Alliance is an association of rulers from cities and
towns across Faerûn (primarily
in the North), who believe that
solidarity is needed to keep evil
at bay. The rulers of Waterdeep,
Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and
other free cities dominate the
coalition, and all lords in the alliance work primarily for the fate
and fortune of their individual
settlements.
Alliance agents include sophisticated bards, zealous paladins,
talented mages, and grizzled
warriors. They are chosen primarily for their loyalty and are experts in observation,
stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy
and the privileged, they carry fine equipment (often disguised to appear common), including large numbers of
scrolls scribed with spells of communication.
Agents of the Lords’ Alliance ensure the safety and
prosperity of civilized Faerûn by standing united against
the forces that threaten civilization. They aggressively
eliminate such threats by any means, fighting with pride
for the glory and security of their people, and for the
welfare of the lords who rule over those folk. Alliance
operatives are often motivated by glory, looking to gain
an advantage in status over their counterparts from
other alliance cities. The leaders of the faction know that
the group will survive only if its members support each
other, requiring all to find a balance between pride and
diplomacy. Rogue agents within the Lords’ Alliance are
rare, but defections have been known to occur.
Everyone wants to sleep at night and feel safe in their homes,
but how many want to do what it takes to keep the tide of
evil at bay? To stand in the cold and rain, waiting for battle
while hunger gnaws at their bellies? Many wish to reap the
rewards of a good harvest, but few care to remove the stones
and till the fields for planting.
The Lords’ Alliance fights the things that the shopkeeper in
his bed has never even heard of. We remove threats before
the town mayor even knows about them. We make bad
things go away. That’s what we’re good at.

 Appendix C: The Five Factions
D&D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only.
The organization encourages individual ambition and
rewards innovators who take matters into their own
hands. Results are all that matter. Those who come
into the Black Network with nothing can become major
players within the organization through their own
ambition and perseverance.
Membership in the Zhentarim is like a key to a thousand
doors, each one a gateway to fulfilling a personal desire.
Most people shy away from this kind of freedom. They like
their restraints, laws, and swaddling—it gives them the illusion of security.
The Black Network provides what I need to explore realms
and dimensions that would tear apart minds accustomed to
limits. Only in such places can I find magic powerful enough
to defeat beings that know no such things as time, fear, or
mercy. You might not like the Zhentarim’s methods, but when
a demon crawls out of the Abyss and comes for your family,
you’ll be glad that I have gone to the darkest of realms to find
the answer to your problem.
—Ianna Asterion
Zhentarim
The Zhentarim, also called the
Black Network, is an organization of well-trained mercenaries,
savvy rogues, and crafty warlocks who seek to expand their
influence and power throughout
Faerûn. Agents of the Zhentarim believe that if they play
by the rules, nothing gets done.
Ultimately, they want to make
the rules—and, in some cases,
they already have. They walk a
careful line when it comes to following the letter of the law and
don’t shy away from the occasional shady deal or illicit activity
to get what they want.
To the Zhentarim, wealth is power. Its agents know
that nothing else inspires such confidence and dispels
doubt so well. Zhentarim agents routinely carry the finest
weapons and armor, since the faction spares no expense
in their outfitting. When a merchant needs an escort for a
caravan, when a noble family requires bodyguards to protect its holdings, or when a city is desperate for trained
soldiers to defend its walls, the Zhentarim provides the
best warriors money can buy.
